**Disciplinary Proceedings \-** Allowing appeal filed by an Advocate and setting aside a judgment of Bar Council of India, SC observed: The genesis of the dispute was a mere misunderstanding regarding the deposit of costs which stood resolved during the pendency of the proceedings, the impugned judgment cannot be sustained. Once the respondent-complainant himself expressed complete satisfaction with the professional services rendered by the appellant-advocate and categorically sought to withdraw the complaint, the very substratum of the disciplinary proceedings ceased to exist.

Jogen Chowdhury 2026 INSC 93 \- Art. 300A \- Demolition Of Privately Owned Property \- PIL**](https://www.caseciter.com/content/files/2026/01/Aarsuday-Projects---Infrastructure--P--Ltd-v.-Jogen-Chowdhury-2026-INSC-93---Art.-300A---Demolition-Of-Privately-Owned-Property---PIL.pdf)

**Demolition \-** In the absence of any tangible evidence of fraud, misrepresentation, or deliberate circumvention of statutory requirements, such a procedural lapse, even if assumed to exist, for arguments sake, could not render the construction per se illegal, nor could it justify the issuance of a direction for demolition, which is an extremely draconian consequence reserved for cases of blatant and substantive illegalities and violation. (Para 36\) \[**Context**: It was contended that Gram Panchayat was not the competent authority to accord approval to the building plan and that such authority vested exclusively in the Panchayat Samiti\]

**Constitution of India \- Article 300A \-** Any interference with privately owned property, including by way of demolition or deprivation of its beneficial use, must therefore rest on a clear statutory foundation and be preceded by due consideration of all relevant factual and legal circumstances. (Para 41\) \[**Context**: The Supreme Court set aside the Calcutta High Court’s order directing demolition of a multi‑storey building constructed by Aarsuday Projects near Visva‑Bharati, holding that there was no clear, scientific or contemporaneous material to show the plot itself was “khoai” land and that the developer had acted on approvals granted by the competent authorities.\]

**Constitution of India \- Article 226 \- Pubic Interest litigation \-**While writ jurisdiction serves an important constitutional purpose, the burden squarely lies on the writ petitioners to place clear, cogent, and reliable material on record in support of the allegations made. Courts exercising writ jurisdiction must remain circumspect while entertaining petitions that hinge upon disputed questions of fact, particularly where such disputes require detailed examination of evidence or adjudication of rival factual claims. Public interest litigation cannot be permitted to become a vehicle for selective or targeted challenges, nor can it be invoked to resolve contested factual issues which are not capable of determination on affidavits alone.

**Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 \- Sections 2(1)(e), 11, 29A \-** If an arbitral tribunal \- appointed by the High Court or by the parties concerned – does not complete proceedings within the required or extended time limit, can an application to extend time under Section 29A of the Act can be filed before the High Court or the Civil Court? The extension of mandate or substitution of an arbitrator under Section 29A does not partake the character of “appointment” under Section 11, but is a measure designed to ensure timely conclusion of arbitration \-The expression “Court” in Section 29A must, therefore, be accorded the meaning assigned to it under Section 2(1)(e).(Para 23\) The view that there will be hierarchical difficulties, conflict of power or jurisdictional anomaly if a Civil Court entertains application under Section 29A for extension of time of an arbitral tribunal if the High Court under Section 11(6) of the Act has appointed the arbitrator(s) is untenable. (Para 20\)

**Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, particularly Sections 11 \-** The enquiry under Section 11 is confined to a prima facie determination of the existence of an arbitration agreement. The enquiry under Section 11 goes no further. (Para 14\) Exercise of jurisdiction under Section 11 stands exhausted upon the constitution of the arbitral tribunal. There is no residual supervisory or controlling power left with the High Court or the Supreme Court over the arbitral proceedings after appointment is made. The referral Court becomes functus officio once appointment has been made, it has no role or function as a Subjudice Sentinel. (Para 15\)

**Interpretation of Statutes \-** A defined term must ordinarily bear the meaning assigned to it “unless the context otherwise require (Para 21\)

**University Grants Commission (Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions) Regulations, 2026 \-** Supreme Court directed that Regulations, 2026 be kept in abeyance- The University Grants Commission (Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions) Regulations, 2012, will continue to operate and remain in force till further orders- The following substantial questions of law arise for consideration and would require detailed examination: (i) Whether the incorporation of Clause 3(c) in the Impugned Regulations, defining “Caste-based Discrimination”, bears a reasonable and rational nexus to subserve the object and purpose of the 2026 UGC Regulations, particularly in light of the fact that no distinct or special procedural mechanism has been prescribed to address caste-based discrimination, as opposed to the exhaustive and inclusive definition of “Discrimination” provided under Clause 3(e) of the Impugned Regulations? (ii) Whether the introduction and operationalisation of “caste-based discrimination” under the Impugned Regulations would have any bearing on the existing constitutional and statutory sub-classification of the Most Backward Castes within the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes, and whether the Impugned Regulations provide adequate and effective protection and safeguards to such Extremely Backward Castes against discrimination and structural disadvantage? (iii) Whether the inclusion of the expression “segregation” in Clause 7(d) of the Impugned Regulations, in the context of allocation of hostels, classrooms, mentorship groups, or similar academic or residential arrangements, albeit on transparent and non-discriminatory criteria, would amount to a “separate yet equal” classification, thereby infringing the constitutional guarantees of equality and fraternity under Articles 14, 15 as well as the Preamble to the Constitution of India? (iv) Whether the omission of the term “Ragging” as a specific form of discrimination in the framework of the Impugned Regulations, despite its existence in the University Grants Commission (Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions) Regulations, 2012, constitutes a regressive and exclusionary legislative omission? If so, whether such 4 omission is violative of unequal treatment of victims of discrimination by creating an asymmetry in access to justice and thus falls foul of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India??

Merely because a chargesheet has been filed against the co-accused does not justify granting anticipatory bail. (Para 11-12)

**Labour Law \- Backwages \-** Ordering back wages to be paid to a dismissed employee – upon his dismissal being set aside by a court of law – is not an automatic relief and, ordinarily, is dependent on the employee being not employed in the interregnum. However, the general rule is that if the employer by reason of its illegal act deprives any of its employees from discharging his work and the termination is ultimately held to be bad in law, such employee has a legitimate and valid claim to be restored with all that he would have received but for being illegally kept away from work. This is based on the principle that although the employee was willing to perform work, it was the employer who did not accept work from him and, therefore, if the employer’s action is held to be illegal and bad, such employer cannot escape from suffering the consequences.

Considering the prolonged pre‑trial custody, likely length of the trial, and without delving into the merits of the accusations, the Supreme Court granted bail and observed: Examination of 159 witnesses or even 50% of the same is going to take a pretty long time. At times, we wonder why prosecution wants to examine so many witnesses and thereby prolong the trial and delay the same. We have observed in number of orders that the prosecution should examine important witnesses and try to establish its case. There is no point in multiplying the witnesses on one and the same issue.

**Constitution of India \- Article 226 \-** The remedy of a writ is discretionary in nature. Even where a writ petition raises a substantial point of law, the High Court may decline to entertain it for a variety of reasons. Inter alia, relief may be denied to the suitor notwithstanding the existence of a strong legal case should grant of such relief not serve or advance public interest. If interfering with an impugned order/decision etc. would result in more harm to society, the writ courts may decline to exercise its jurisdiction. The high courts, being the custodian of the Constitution, carry the responsibility to maintain social balance by its interference when justice of the case so demands and in not interfering when such an interference would affect public interest. (Para 11\)

**Constitution of India \- Article 226 \- Writ Appeal \- Intra Court Appeal \-** The exercise of intra-court appellate jurisdiction is warranted only where the judgment or order under challenge is demonstrably erroneous or suffers from perversity. Such jurisdiction ought not to be invoked merely because another view is possible on the same set of facts, particularly where the view adopted by the Single Judge is a plausible and reasonable one- An intra-court appellate Bench ought not to substitute its own view, merely because such Bench considers its view to be better than the one taken by the Single Bench; so long as the view taken by the Single Bench is a plausible one, interference should stay at a distance.

Their importance cannot be measured merely in quantitative terms. For their effective functioning and sustained growth, the availability of adequate resources, including land, is indispensable. (Para 16\)

**Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita 2023 (BNSS) \- Section 175(4)-** The opening words in sub-section (4) which reads “Any Magistrate empowered under Section 210, may, upon receiving a complaint against a public servant ……” have to be purposively read as ‘Any Magistrate empowered under Section 210, may, upon receiving a complaint in writing against a public servant of commission of offence arising in course of the discharge of his official duties, supported by an affidavit, order investigation, subject to ... ’ (Para 39)– Upon receiving a complaint under sub-section (4) of Section 175, BNSS alleging commission of an offence by a public servant arising in course of the discharge of his official duties, the magistrate may do either of the following- (1) Reading the complaint, if the judicial magistrate is prima facie satisfied that commission of the alleged act giving rise to an offence arose in course of discharge of official duties by the public servant, such magistrate may not have any option other than following the procedure prescribed under sub-section (4) of Section 175 of calling for reports from the superior officer and the accused public servant. Or (2) on a consideration of the complaint, where the judicial magistrate entertains a prima facie doubt depending upon the circumstances as to whether the offence alleged to have been committed by the public servant arose in course of discharge of his official duties, such magistrate might err on the side of caution and proceed to follow the procedure prescribed in sub-section (4) of Section 175 Or (3) where the judicial magistrate is satisfied that the alleged act of offence was not committed in the discharge of official duties and/or it bears no reasonable nexus thereto, and also that the rigours of sub-section (4) of Section 175 are not attracted, the complaint may be dealt with in accordance with the general procedure prescribed under sub-section (3) of Section 175\. The judicial magistrate would continue to retain the authority to reject an application under sub-section (3) of Section 175, lodged against a public servant, where such magistrate finds that the allegations made therein are wholly untenable, manifestly absurd, or so inherently improbable that no reasonable person could conclude that any offence is disclosed. However, it is needless to observe, such an order of rejection ought not to be based on whims and fancy but must have the support of valid reasons- in an appropriate case, the judicial magistrate has called for a report from the concerned superior officer under clause (a) of sub-section (4) of Section 175, but such officer fails to comply with the direction or does not submit the report within a reasonable period of time- the judicial magistrate is not obliged to wait indefinitely for compliance and 43 may proceed further in accordance with sub-section (3) of Section 175 after considering the version of the accused public servant under clause (b) of sub-section (4) of Section 175, if on record. What would constitute ‘reasonable time’ cannot be determined in rigid or inflexible terms and must necessarily depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case before the judicial magistrate who has to take the call. (Para 42-48)

**Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita 2023 (BNSS) \- Section 175 (3) , 333 \-** An affidavit, such as the one referred to in subsection (3) of Section 175, must fulfil the conditions provided in Section 333, BNSS. (Para 41\)

**Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita 2023 (BNSS) \-** Section Section 218 \- Section 218 operates at the stage of taking cognizance when the “previous sanction” of the concerned Government is required. (Para 40\)

**Interpretation of Statutes \- Proviso \-** A proviso is an internal aid to construction. It is appended to a section of an enactment or any sub-section of a section. A proviso to a particular provision of a statute only embraces the field which is covered by the main provision. It carves out an exception to the main provision to which it has been enacted as a proviso and to no other. A test one may apply to determine whether a provision is a proviso rather than a separate provision is to ask whether if the “main” provision is removed, would the concerned provision still be capable of being applied. If yes, then the provision cannot normally be considered a proviso. (Para 32-36) **Sub-Section** \- Ordinarily, sub-sections of a section of an Act usually deal with related, parallel aspects with one sub-section dealing with a general principle and the other providing for a specific aspect, on its own terms. (Para 37.2)

**Constitution of India \- Article 226 \-** The writ court will, normally, grant relief that is prayed; and, though discretion to grant relief under Article 226 is wide, the writ court cannot, ignoring and keeping aside the norms and principles governing grant of relief, proceed to grant a relief not even prayed by the petitioner. (Para 51\)

**Constitution of India \- Article 226 \-** Seeking a declaratory relief that the acts of offence committed by the accused public servants did not arise in the discharge of official duties by them without the order of the JMFC (calling for a report) being challenged would have necessarily required the writ court to embark on a fact-finding exercise in that behalf, as if it were a court of a magistrate. A writ court is a court exercising high prerogative writ jurisdiction; such court could not have been urged by the appellant to convert itself into a court for conducting sort of a magisterial inquiry. (Para 56\)

**Constitution of India \- Article 226 \-** A judicial order in a civil matter cannot be challenged in a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution- the principle has been extended to judicial orders passed in criminal matters. (Para 52\)

**Summary**: Supreme Court upheld the Kerala High Court Division Bench’s reversal of the Single Judge, holds that the Single Judge exceeded writ jurisdiction by effectively directing recall of a judicial order of the Magistrate.

By applying the same rule of interpretation, it can be construed that the appropriate Government may refer an Industrial Dispute apprehended to the Board, Labour Court and Tribunal. (Para 34\) Even if an unfair labour practice is alleged, the applicable statute is the ID Act and the forum, the labour court.

If it falls short of such a plenary acknowledgment of guilt it would not be a confession even though the same is of some incriminating fact which taken with other evidence tends to prove his guilt.

**Constitution of India \- Article 226 ; Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \- Order I Rule 10 \- Practice and Procedure \- Registry \-** It is for petitioner to decide who is to be joined as a party and who is not to be joined. Registry cannot make inroads into areas within the exclusive domain of the judiciary and seek clarification as to why a particular party has been joined as a respondent. Unnecessary parties could be deleted by the High Court referring to principles flowing from Order I Rule 10, CPC. If any party has been mischievously joined with an intention to harass him or with some hidden ill-motive, it is open to the High Court to unearth the truth and deal with the situation appropriately on the judicial side. (Para 11\) \[Context: In this case, the High Court had upheld the registry objections relating to the form of the prayer and the array of parties in the writ petition \- Supreme Court set aside the HC order\]

**Constitution of India \- Article 226 ; Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \- Order VII Rule 7, 11-** Order VI Rule 17 When a suitor claims a larger or wider relief than what he is entitled to, his claim (be it a writ petition or a suit) cannot be dismissed by the court on that ground. Should the court find the suitor entitled to a lesser relief than the larger or wider relief claimed, there is no bar in granting such lesser relief \-A court cannot grant a larger or wider relief to the suitor than that claimed by him \- The grounds on the existence of which rejection of a plaint is permissible are traceable to Order VII Rule 11, CPC whereas dismissal of a writ petition at the threshold is permissible on several grounds raised as objections to maintainability \- rejection of a writ petition on the ground that multiple relief has been claimed in a single prayer is, perhaps, unprecedented. Even, moulding of relief without insisting on amendment of the prayer clause, should a case be set up therefor, is not unknown to writ jurisprudence. (Para 10\)

**Specific Relief Act 1963 \- Section 34 \- Declaration Suit \- Registered Sale Deed \-**Strong presumption about the validity and genuineness- A Court must not lightly or casually declare a registered instrument as a “sham” \- The burden of proof to displace this presumption rests heavily upon the challenger. Such a challenge can only be sustained if the party provides material particulars and cogent evidence to demonstrate that the Deed was never intended to operate as a bona fide transfer of title \- The grounds typically accepted to challenge a registered Deed at the instance of the vendee/executant are fraud or want of capacity in any party or mistake of fact or fundamental illegality like where the Deed was executed under deceit or sold by a fraudster who did not own the land or where the Deed was executed without consideration, namely, if no money or value was actually exchanged despite recitals in the Deeds or where there was coercion or intimidation like where the seller was forced to sign without free consent. (Para 31-32) 

**Pleading Standards \- Code of Civil Procedure \- Order VI Rule 4 \-** The person alleging that a registered Deed is a sham must satisfy a rigorous standard of pleading by making clear, cogent, convincing averments and provide material particulars in his pleadings and evidence. This Court is of the view that the test akin to a test under Order VI Rule 4 CPC is applicable to such a pleading and clever drafting creating illusion of cause of action would not be permitted and a clear right to sue would have to be shown in the plaint.

**Registration \- Reforms \-** Urgent need for the digitization of registered documents and land records using secure, tamper-proof technologies such as Blockchain. Many experts believe that Blockchain, a shared, digital record book (ledger) system would ensure that once a transaction of a sale or mortgage or like nature is recorded, it becomes immutable and cryptographically secured- Such reforms are essential to minimize the scourge of forgery and "clever drafting" that clogs our judicial system. Registered documents must inspire absolute confidence to ensure the ease of doing business and to uphold the sanctity of property titles in a modern economy. (Para 76-77)

**Foreign Trade (Development and Regulation) Act, 1992 \- Section 3 \-** Notification issued under Section 3 of the Act acquires the force of law only upon its publication in the Official Gazette. The expression ‘date of this Notification’ must necessarily mean the date of such publication \- DGFT Minimum Import Price notification acquired force of law only upon publication in the Official Gazette on 11.02.2016, not on the earlier website upload. (Para 22-23)

**Legislation \-** Law, to bind, must first exist. And to exist, it must be made known in the manner ordained by the legislature (Para 16)- Before a law can become operative, it must be promulgated or published \- It must be broadcast in some recognisable way so that all men may know what it is, or, at the very least, there must be some special rule or regulation or customary channel by or through which such knowledge can be acquired with exercise of due and reasonable diligence. (Para 17\) 

**Delegated Legislation \-** Publication of promulgation is indispensable to enforceability of subordinate legislation- When the parent statute prescribes a particular mode of publication, that mode must be strictly followed (Para 18)- The true test of the effective commencement of a statutory order or subordinate legislation is whether it has been published in a manner reasonably calculated to bring it to the notice of all persons who may be affected by it, namely, through a mode which is ordinarily and generally accepted for that purpose. (Para 17\) Once the legislature has prescribed the specified mode of promulgation, the executive cannot introduce an alternative mode and attribute legal consequences to it. (Para 19\)

**Constitution of India \- Article 226 \-** In a writ petition, which is decided on affidavits, the burden of establishing the existence of the facts asserted squarely lies upon the writ petitioner, and such burden can be discharged only by placing clear and unimpeachable material on record.

**Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 \- Section 34** \- If an arbitral tribunal’s view is found to be a possible and plausible one, it cannot be substituted merely because an alternate view is possible. Construction and interpretation of a contract and its terms is a matter for the arbitral tribunal to determine. Unless the same is found to be one that no fair-minded or reasonable person would arrive at, it cannot be interfered with. If there are two plausible interpretations of the terms of a contract, then no fault can be found if the arbitrator accepts one such interpretation as against the other. To be in conflict with the public policy of India, the award must contravene the fundamental policy of Indian law, which makes it narrower in its application. (Para 59\)

Notwithstanding the dates from which these two enactments were brought into force, the BOCW Act and the Cess Act remained dormant, in fact, owing to the failure of the appropriate Governments in taking necessary measures to bring the provisions thereof into actual effect \-The Cess Act is complementary to the BOCW Act and was enacted for augmenting the resources of the Welfare Boards, constituted under Section 18 of the BOCW Act. Therefore, in the absence of such Welfare Boards, levy and collection of cess under the Cess Act did not arise, given the scheme and structure of the two Acts and the Rules \- constitution of Welfare Boards was essential and was a condition precedent for levy and collection of the cess in relation to the BOCW Act and the Cess Act. The registration of workers or providing of welfare measures to them, however, are not pre-conditions for the levy and collection of such cess. (Para 59\)

**Bail \-** When an accused is enlarged on bail, police custody cannot be granted so long as the order of bail continues to operate \- Where the investigating agency seeks police remand of an accused who has already been enlarged on bail, the proper and legally permissible course is to first seek cancellation of bail in accordance with law and only thereafter apply for police custody. The scheme of criminal procedure does not countenance the grant of police remand of an accused who continues to enjoy the protection of bail, as such a course would effectively defeat and nullify the order granting bail.

**Matrimonial Matters \-** Warring couples cannot be allowed to settle their scores by treating Courts as their battlefield and choke the system. If there is no compatibility, there are modes available for early resolution of disputes. Process of mediation is the mode which can be explored at the stage of pre-litigation and even after litigation starts. When the parties start litigating against each other, especially on criminal side, the chances of reunion are remote but should not be ruled out. (Para 21\) First and the foremost, earnest effort should be made by the parties and to be guided by the advocates, whensoever consulted in the process, is to convince them for a pre-litigation mediation. Rather in some cases, their counselling may be required \- Even if a case is filed in a Court on a trivial issue such as maintenance under Section 144 of BNSS, 2023 (earlier Section 125 of CrPC, 1973\) or Section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, the first effort required to be made by the Court is to explore mediation instead of calling upon the parties for filing replies as allegations and counter allegations sometimes aggravate the dispute. Even when a complaint is sought to be registered with the police of simple matrimonial dispute, first and the foremost effort has to be for re-conciliation, that too, if possible, through the mediation centers in the Courts, instead of calling the parties to the police stations. This sometimes becomes a point of no return specially when any of the parties is arrested, may it be even for a day. (Para 24\) It is the duty of all concerned including the family members of the parties to make their earnest effort to resolve the disputes before any civil or criminal proceedings are launched.(Para 25\)

(Para 3\)

**Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988: Sections 17 \-** Section 17 does not exclude or prevents the State Police or a Special Agency of the State from registering a crime or investigating cases relating to bribery, corruption and misconduct against Central Government employes- The Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) is also a wing of State Police- The offences under the PC Act are also cognizable and can, therefore, be investigated by the State Police or VACB \- The only rider is that the investigation can be done only by a police officer of the rank specified in Section 17 of the PC Act. (Para 8\)

**Criminal Investigation \-** The relation between the CBI and the State Police is supplementary to each other and as per the CBI constitution and inter se arrangement between CBI and State police there are several areas where the CBI and the Police require inter se cooperation and support.

The Regulations are not Recruitment Rules but are Promotion and Progression Rules \- To apply AICTE Regulations to a candidate participating in recruitment for the post of Professors in the Engineering Colleges in the State conducted by the Commission under State Rules framed by the State, would be to stretch the AICTE Regulations beyond its text, context, and purpose. The law does not permit a regulation crafted as a ladder to be used as a gate. Thus, the AICTE Regulations do not apply to the process of direct recruitment under the State Rules. (Para 13-15)

**Bihar Pharmacist Cadre Rules, 2014 (as amended in 2024\) \-** Constitutional Validity Upheld \- The prescription of eligibility criteria of 10+2 with Diploma in Pharmacy by the State cannot be said to be arbitrary or irrational- the decision of the State in making possession of a Diploma an essential qualification for appointment cannot be said to be arbitrary. The State has merely identified a narrower catchment of candidates it considers most suitable for a particular purpose, from within the larger pool registered pharmacists. (Para 62\) There is no absolute exclusion of graduate or postgraduate degree holders. They remain eligible, provided they possess the essential qualification of Diploma in Pharmacy.(Para 64\)

**Pharmacy Act, 1948 \-** The Act creates a pool of persons eligible to practise as pharmacists, it does not mandate that every registered pharmacist must be considered for appointment to public posts. Its scope does not extend to conferring a right to public employment merely by virtue of registration \- The Act only creates a pool of eligible persons who may be appointed as pharmacists. (Para 47-49)

**Constitution of India \- Article 226 \-** The power of judicial review in matters of recruitment is limited to examining legislative competence, arbitrariness or violation of fundamental rights, if any. Courts cannot rewrite service rules, determine equivalence of qualifications, or substitute their own assessment for that of the employer. The scope of judicial review in matters of public employment does not extend to questioning the State’s wisdom or policy in prescribing the minimum eligibility requirements for a public post. Qualifications are prescribed keeping in view the needs and interests of an institution, an industry or an establishment, as the case may be. Similarly, equivalence of a qualification is not a matter which can be determined in exercise of the power of judicial review. Whether a particular qualification should or should not be regarded as equivalent is a matter for the State, as the recruiting authority, to determine. The assessment of the expediency, advisability or utility of such prescription of qualifications do not warrant intervention of the Courts unless the same are shown to be perverse. However, at the same time, the employer cannot act arbitrarily in prescribing qualifications for posts. (Para 59\)

**Constitution of India \- Article 309** \- The power to frame rules under Article 309 of the Constitution of India empowers the State to determine the most suitable qualifications for public posts based on its independent assessment. (Para 50\)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 378 \- Appeal against Acquittal \-** If two reasonable conclusions are possible on the basis of the evidence on record, the Appellate Court should not disturb the findings of acquittal recorded by the Trial Court. Further, if the view taken is a possible view, the Appellate Court cannot overturn the order of acquittal on the ground that another view was also possible.- Principles Summarized: (a) whether the judgment of acquittal suffers from patent perversity; (b) whether the judgment is based on misreading/omission to consider the material evidence on record; (c) an order of acquittal is to be interfered with only when there are “compelling and substantial reasons” for doing so. If the order is “clearly unreasonable”, it is a compelling reason for interference.’ (d) the appellate court, while deciding an appeal against acquittal, after reappreciating the evidence, is required to consider whether the view taken by the trial court is a possible view which could have been taken on the basis of the evidence on record; (e) if the view taken is a possible view, the appellate court cannot overturn the order of acquittal on the ground that another view was also possible; and (f) the appellate court can interfere with the order of acquittal only if it comes to a finding that the only conclusion which can be recorded on the basis of the evidence on record was that the guilt of the accused was proved beyond a reasonable doubt and no other conclusion was possible.

**Interpretation of Statutes \- Taxing Statute \-** The principle of strict interpretation of a taxing statute, particularly in the context of charging provisions \- In construing fiscal statutes and in determining the liability of a subject to tax one must have regard to the strict letter of law. If the revenue satisfies the court that the case falls strictly within the provisions of the law, the subject can be taxed. If, on the other hand, the case is not covered within the four corners of the provisions of the taxing statute, no tax can be imposed by inference or by analogy or by trying to probe into the intentions of the legislature and by considering what was the substance of the matter.

**Finance Act, 1994 \- Event Management Contracts** \- The expressions ‘event management’ and ‘event managers’ is commonly understood in the sense of appointing someone to manage or organize the event. Individual contract for booking of persons required for participation in the event are not commonly understood as “event management” contracts. (Para 48\)

**Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968 \- Section 3(2) Proviso 1 \-** In a case where notices of motion were given in both Houses on the same day, the fact that a notice is not admitted in one House will not necessitate constitution of a Joint Committee and the Speaker or the Chairman, as the case may be, can independently proceed to constitute a Committee- There is nothing in the Inquiry Act to suggest that rejection of a motion in one House would render the other House incompetent to proceed in accordance with law- It does not contemplate a scenario where a notice of motion is accepted in one House and rejected in the other. The proviso applies to only one specific situation, namely, where notices of motion given on the same day have been admitted by both Houses. It does not restrict or negate the individual authority of either House of Parliament. (Para 12-14) **Role of the Secretary General \-**Where no prescribed format exists, a notice containing allegations of impropriety against a Judge could not reasonably be treated as ineffective solely on account of perceived deficiencies in drafting or form. The role of the Secretary General was confined to placing the notice before the competent authority, namely, the office of the Chairman, without expressing any conclusion as to its admissibility. (Para 50\)

**Constitution of India \- Article 124** \- The process of removal of a Judge is indeed a tedious one involving various stages \- Discussed (Para 1-6)

**Constitution of India \- Article 226 \-** Writ jurisdiction is exercised to test the legality of an existing order, and not to grant relief on the hypothesis that another authority ought to have acted differently- The settled limits of writ jurisdiction do not permit the Court to confer relief in vacuum, divorced from a direct challenge to the order which is alleged to be the source of illegality. (Para 45\) If an order has been passed to the prejudice or detriment of a suitor and such suitor seeks to have the order declared invalid and quashed in writ proceedings, it is imperative that he lays the order to a challenge, makes specific averments and urges cogent legal grounds to demonstrate its invalidity to enable him claim relief based thereon. (Para 40\)

**Constitution of India \- Article 32-** The extraordinary remedy under Article 32 is confined to enforcement of Fundamental Rights and does not extend to issuing advisory or corrective directions in relation to internal statutory mechanisms of the Parliament, where no present or inevitable infraction of any Fundamental Right is evinced. (Para 55\)

**Interpretation of Statutes** \- To read the statute in isolation of the Constitution would be grossly incorrect. Any interpretation of a statute which has the effect of generating an interpretation fouling the Constitution should be eschewed. (Para 17.2-4) \-**Proviso**: A proviso cannot be read in a way which nullifies the provision to which it is a proviso , unless such an intention is manifest. (Para 12.4)

**Disciplinary Proceedings** \- Every infraction of the rules governing discipline and control does not, by itself, vitiate disciplinary proceedings. A plea founded on infraction of procedure must necessarily be examined through the prism of prejudice, having regard to the nature of the rule alleged to have been infracted, namely, whether it is mandatory or merely directory. Such an enquiry presupposes the existence of infraction of a governing rule. (Para 34\)

**Service Law \- Waiting List \-** The key aspects of a waiting list, in relation to service law disputes: (i) a waiting list is normally prepared after the select/merit list is drawn; (ii) it would include candidates who have qualified the recruitment examination but are not so meritorious such that they can be immediately appointed on the number of vacancies advertised; (iii) such list would operate like a merit-based queue for vacancies that remain unfilled after offers of appointment given to the candidates in the select/merit list are not accepted; (iv) a waiting list has a limited validity period; (v) validity period of a waiting list depends on the recruitment rules and should no such period be mentioned, it can bona fide be operated till the next advertisement is issued without, however, violating provisions in such rules, if any, requiring recruitment process to be initiated either semi-annually or annually; and (vi) an opportunity to a candidate in the waiting list for securing appointment arises only when vacancies remain unfilled after the process of appointing candidates from the select/merit list is over and hence, it is regarded as a procedural outcome which is part of a structured process rather than a fortuitous circumstance- A wait-listed candidate has no right of appointment, much less an indefeasible right, except when the governing recruitment rules permit a small window authorizing appointments therefrom in the specified exceptional circumstances and the appointing authority, for no good reason, denies or refuses an appointment or the reason assigned therefor is found to be arbitrary and/or discriminatory and that too, when the waiting list has not expired.  (Para 86-90)

**Constitution of India \- Article 226 \-Intra Court Jurisdiction \- Letters patent appeal \-** A letters patent appeal, as permitted under the Letters Patent, is normally an intra-court appeal whereunder the Letters Patent Bench, sitting as a “Court of Correction”, corrects its own orders in exercise of the same jurisdiction as was vested in the Single Bench: Exercise of intra-court appellate jurisdiction could be called for if the judgment/order under challenge is palpably erroneous or suffers from perversity; but, it may not be exercised when two views are possible on a given set of facts and one of two views has been taken which is a plausible view.  (Para 50-51) “**Person aggrieved”:** A writ appeal is a continuation of the original writ petition \- anyone who may file a writ petition would have the locus standi to file a writ appeal albeit with some caveats: A person aggrieved having locus standi to prefer an appeal would be one who is directly affected or impacted by a judgment, order or decision even though the same does not directly require him to do something, or, one, who being a party to a suit, is adversely affected by the decree. To file an appeal, such a person typically needs to show affectation of a legal right or interest, or that he is likely to suffer a legal wrong as a result of its impact. A mere interest or concern in the subject matter decided by the original court would not be enough \- the conditions that need to be satisfied before a person is entitled to maintain an appeal. These are: 1\) that the appealing party has been a party in the proceedings from which the appeal has arisen; 2\) that the definitive and conclusive ruling of the High Court on the rights of the parties in dispute is the subject of the appeal; and 3\) that he is a ‘person aggrieved’, that is, a party who has been adversely affected by the determination.  Condition (1) supra may, however, stand relaxed in given cases (Para 50- 67\)

**Appeal** \-An appeal is always a creature of statute \- The right of appeal is the right of reaching out to a superior court, invoking its authority to have a relook at the facts vis-àvis the law applicable and to rectify the errors committed by a court inferior in the hierarchy. It is a very valuable right. Therefore, when the statute confers such a right of appeal, it is open to the person aggrieved to seek correction of the errors committed by the inferior court. (Para 45-46)

**Public Service Commission** \- Although the recommendations made by a Public Service Commission are not binding and hence, may or may not be accepted by the Government of the State, one thing is clear: the latter has no authority to appoint anyone not recommended by the former. (Para 73\)

**Executive instructions**  \- executive instructions may supplement, but not supplant, statutory rules and should be subservient to statutory provisions.

**Constitution of India \- Article 14,226** \- Perpetuation of illegality ought to be shunned by any Court of law. This forms the basis for denying the plea of negative equality \-The illegality in recommending some of the candidates figuring in the reserve list could not have been made the basis for issuance of a writ of mandamus citing Article 14 of the Constitution.  (Para 101-102)

**Constitution of India \- Article 226 \- Service Disputes** \- A substantial number of service-related disputes pending across the country are aggravated by protracted and recurring litigation, resulting in a state of perpetual flux for many candidates across the country. The judiciary would do well to remain circumspect of these practical realities, and interpret service rules in a manner that furthers the very object of a selection process, that is, the selection of the most suitable candidates from suitable candidates for appointment in a timely manner. (Para 123\)

**Summary**: Appeal by the Rajasthan Public Service Commission against High Court orders that had directed the appointment of candidates from a reserve list after several originally selected individuals failed to join their posts \- Allowing appeal, SC held  that the Commission had the locus standi to appeal as a constitutional body ; wait-listed candidates possess no indefeasible right to appointment, particularly once the statutory validity period of the list has lapsed; the six-month validity of a reserve list under the relevant rules must be strictly calculated from the date the original list was forwarded rather than from the date a vacancy later arose due to non-joining.

**Drug Rules, 1945** \-State made Rules cannot be construed so as to invalidate or prevail over the central Drug Rules (Para 44)- The rules framed by the State Government by adding experience in addition to the qualification prescribed by the Drugs Rules cannot be made applicable for their appointment as Inspectors. (Para 50\)

**Legal Maxim** \- Expressio unius est exclusio alterius’ means the “express mention of one thing excludes others.”  \[**Context**: SC held that once the Centre has consciously and expressly occupied the field by placing the Drug Rules framed 55 under the D\&C Act before both Houses of the Parliament as provided under Section 38, any inconsistent exercise of power by the State, even under the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution of India, stands impliedly excluded. \]

**Higher Educational Institutions \- Student Suicides \-** The Supreme Court, acknowledging a surge in student suicides, reviewed an interim report from a National Task Force that identified systemic stressors in Higher Educational Institutions—ranging from inadequate support systems, ragging, academic pressure, financial delays, and poor mental health services—to fragmented implementation of existing policies. Exercising Article 142, the Court issued directions including mandatory police reporting of any student suicide or unnatural death, annual reporting to regulators, filling faculty and leadership vacancies within four months, clearing scholarship backlogs promptly, ensuring round-the-clock medical access, and strict compliance with UGC regulations on equity, anti‑ragging, sexual harassment, and grievance redressal. The Court also asked the Task Force to develop model SOPs for wellbeing audits, faculty training, and campus mental health services, aiming for a unified, enforceable student well‑being framework.

**General Anti-Avoidance Rule-** The prescription of the cut-off date of investment under Rule 10U(1)(d) stands diluted by Rule 10U(2), if any tax benefit is obtained based on such arrangement. The duration of the arrangement is irrelevant. (Para 46\)

**International Law \- Taxation \-** It is a fundamental rule of international taxation that every nation has a sovereign right to impose tax on the global income of its residents and on income that accrues or arises within its territorial limits. These twin rights are referred to as residence-based or source-based taxation \- **Tax Treaty \-** Treaty provisions are expressions of sovereign policy of more than one sovereign State, negotiated and entered into at a political/diplomatic level and having several explicit and/or subliminal and unarticulated considerations as their bases. A tax treaty must be seen in the context of aiding commercial relations between treaty partners and as being essentially a bargain between Contracting States as to the division of tax revenues between them in respect of income falling to be taxed in both jurisdictions. (Para 38-39)

**Taxation \- Tax Planning \- Tax Evasion \-** Though it is permissible in law for an assessee to plan his transaction so as to avoid the levy of tax, the mechanism must be permissible and in conformity with the parameters contemplated under the provisions of the Act, rules, or notifications. Once the mechanism is found to be illegal or sham, it ceases to be “a permissible avoidance” and becomes “an impermissible avoidance” or “evasion” (Para 49\)

**Legislation** \-Parliament is well within its right to bring in a law, either by amendment, substitution, or introduction so as to remove the basis of a judicial decision. (Para 27\)

**Circulars** \- Circulars though binding on the Revenue at the time of their issuance, operate only within the legal regime in which they were issued and cannot override subsequent statutory amendments. (Para 27\)

**Transfer of Property Act 1882- Section 54 \-** A contract for sale (agreement to sell) would not confer any title nor transfer any interest in an immovable property (except to the limited right granted under Section 53A of the Act). Thus, an agreement to sell or a contract for sale with or without possession is not a conveyance deed. Therefore, a sale of immovable property can only be made by a registered instrument and that an agreement of sale does not create any interest or charge on its subject matter. (Para 5.10)

**Transfer of Property Act 1882- Section 53A-** Section 53A applies to a person who contracts to transfer immovable property in writing. If the proposed transferee in the agreement has taken possession of the property or he continues in possession thereof being already in possession in part 26 performance of the contract and has done some act in furtherance of the contract and transferee has performed or is willing to perform his part of the contract, the transferor shall be debarred from enforcing any right in respect of the property- In a case where a person claims benefit of part performance, evidence that he was inducted into possession for the first time subsequent to the contract, would be a strong piece of evidence regarding the contract and of possession changing hands pursuant to the contract. Continuous possession of a tenant in the suit property even after entering into the sale agreements would not by itself amount to a part-performance, putting the tenant in possession of the suit properties pursuant to the sale agreements. (Para 5.12-13)

**Transfer of Property Act 1882- Section 111 \-** Distinction between an express and implied surrender \- While express surrender is a matter of intention of the parties, implied surrender is by implication of the law. An implied surrender is the act of the law and takes place independently of and in some cases even in spite of the intention of the parties. (Para 5.7)

**Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 \- Section 7-** The right to initiate or participate in insolvency proceedings is statutory, not equitable \- A society or Resident Welfare Association, not being a creditor in its own right and not recognised as an authorised representative of allottees under the IBC, has no locus standi to intervene in proceedings arising out a Section 7 petition (Para 13.22)- Proceedings under Section 7 are essentially bipartite at the admission stage, involving only the financial creditor and the corporate debtor. Unrelated third parties including other creditors, have no independent right of audience at this stage.(Para 13.11) At the pre-admission stage, proceedings under Section 7 remain in personam, and neither the Adjudicating Authority nor the Appellate Authority is required to hear other creditors, much less unrelated third parties. When proceedings are in personam, no right of audience inheres in persons who are strangers to the debt and default forming the basis of the application. (Para 13.5)

**Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 \- Section 30-** If the CoC approves a resolution plan in derogation of the objectives, scheme, and ethos of the Code, the NCLT is not rendered powerless at the stage of approval (Para 12.17)- While the commercial wisdom of the Committee of Creditors is paramount and is not ordinarily amenable to judicial review, the width of powers vested in the CoC carries with it a corresponding duty of responsibility. Any extraordinary or non-routine decision taken by the CoC must be supported by cogent reasons duly recorded in writing. (Para 15.1)

**Indian Evidence Act 1872 \- Section 32 \-** A dying declaration need not be made in expectation of immediate death; that a conviction under Section 302 IPC can rest solely on a dying declaration if it is found to be voluntary, truthful and reliable; and that corroboration is not a rule of law but one of prudence. (Para 16\) \- The law does not prescribe any rigid form for recording a dying declaration. So long as the Court is satisfied that the declaration is voluntary, truthful and reliable, hyper-technical objections cannot form the basis for its rejection. (Para 18.3) No absolute proposition that a dying declaration must invariably be discarded in the absence of corroboration. Each case must necessarily turn on its own facts. (Para 25\)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 378,386-** Where a judgment of acquittal is found to be manifestly erroneous, perverse, or founded on a misreading of evidence or incorrect application of law, this Court would be justified to set aside the acquittal and record a conviction, albeit exercising such power with circumspection and in exceptional circumstances. (Para 13\)

**Criminal Trial \- Hostile Witness \-**The testimony of a hostile witness can be relied upon only to the extent it is corroborated by other reliable evidence. (Para 20\) 

**Motive**\- Motive assumes significance, primarily in cases based on circumstantial evidence. Where there is direct evidence in the form of a credible and trustworthy dying declaration, the absence of strong proof of motive is not fatal to the prosecution case. (Para 23\)

**Constitution of India \- Article 21A ; Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 \- Section 12**\- The obligation of a “neighbourhood school” to admit children belonging to weaker and disadvantaged sections of our society- It is necessary and compelling to formulate subordinate legislation by issuing necessary rules and regulations, prescribing the method and manner by which children of weaker and disadvantaged sections are to be admitted in neighbourhood schools. Without such enforceable rules and regulations, the object of Article 21A and the statutory policy under Section 12(1)(c) would be a dead letter \- Supreme Court direct the appropriate authorities to prepare and issue, in consultation with the NCPCR and SCPCRs, as the case may be, as well as the National and State Advisory Councils, necessary rules and regulations under Section 38 of the Act for implementing the mandate of Section 12(1)(c) of the Act. 

**Constitution of India \- Article 21A \-**The consequence of identifying the right to elementary education as a positive right is the recognition of corelative duties and identification of five duty bearers, being (i) the appropriate government, (ii) the local authority, (iii) the neighbourhood schools, (iv) the parents/guardians, and (v) the primary school teachers. (Para 6\)

**Constitution of India \- Fraternity \-**A correct appreciation of fraternity must displace the traditional but mistaken view, often repeated in constitutional discourse, that it is not an enforceable value. Our constitutional jurisprudence compels us to read fraternity as a value requiring the State to structure institutions that nurture co-existence, mutual respect, and a sense of common membership. Unlike equality and liberty, which are frequently framed as individual rights-claims, fraternity is relational; it operates through institutional arrangements that enable individuals to “lose suspect identities” based on caste, class or other hierarchies and to form solidaristic bonds.

**Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 \- Section 21,22-** “Any widow of the son” of a deceased Hindu is a dependant within the meaning of Section 21 (vii) of the Act and is entitled to claim maintenance under Section 22 of the Act \- (Para 29\) A widow of the deceased son of the Hindu is a dependant irrespective of the time she becomes a widow (Para 15)- It cannot be interpreted to mean that only a widow of the predeceased son of a Hindu would be covered by the said definition. (Para 16\)

**Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 \- Section 19,22-** Section 19 contemplates for the maintenance of the daughter-in-law during the lifetime of father-in-law, whereas, Section 22 contemplates “maintenance of dependants” including “widowed daughterin-law” from the estate of her father-in-law meaning thereby that a claim under Section 22 can be raised only after the death of the father-in-law. (Para 28\)

**Constitution of India \- Article 14 \-**The classification sought to be made between widowed daughters-in-law based solely on the timing of the husband’s death, namely, (a) those whose husbands died 11 during the lifetime of the father-in-law, and (b) those whose husbands died after him; is manifestly unreasonable and arbitrary- Denial of maintenance to one category based on a fortuitous circumstance beyond their control is manifestly arbitrary and violative of the guarantee of equality before law under Article 14 of the Constitution (Para 23\) Article 21 \-Article 21 of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to life with dignity. The right to life has been judicially expanded to include the right to livelihood and basic sustenance. Denying maintenance to a widowed daughter-in-law from the estate of her deceased father-inlaw on a narrow or technical construction of the statute would expose her to destitution and social marginalization, thereby offending her fundamental right to live with dignity. (Para 24\)

**Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 \- Section 4-** Section 4 of the Act has an overriding effect but it does not erase away fundamental principles of Hindu law particularly where some doubt is raised about the codified provisions. \[Context: Supreme Court quotes ""No mother, no father, no wife, and no son deserves to be forsaken." from Manu Smriti while interpreting a provision in Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act in favour of a widow.\]

**Interpretation of Statutes \-** It is a cardinal principle of interpretation of law that where the provision is clear and unambiguous, it has to be interpreted literally provided the literal interpretation is not in conflict with the purpose of the Act or is otherwise not impractical \- The courts cannot add or subtract any word from the text of the statute. The provisions of the statute cannot be re-written by the courts by assuming or inferring something which is not implicit from the plain language of the statute. (Para 17-22)

The gravity is significantly compounded when the non-disclosure is repeated, as it ceases to be accidental or inadvertent and instead reflects deliberate concealment. Such strikes at the core of trust reposed in candidates for public service, where honesty and transparency are indispensable attributes, and justify a far stricter view by the authorities.

**Code of Civil Procedure, 1908: Order XXII \- Abatement-** Before declaring a suit or proceeding to have abated on ground of non-substitution of the heirs/ legal representatives of a deceased party, the Court must examine whether the interest of the deceased party qua the subject matter of the proceeding is sufficiently represented by other parties already on record. If the interest of the deceased party is sufficiently represented by other parties already on record, and the decree/order eventually passed in the suit or proceeding would not be rendered non-executable for absence of that party, the suit or proceeding would not abate. (Para 38(1))

**Specific Performance Suit-** In a suit for specific performance of an agreement for sale of an immovable property, vendor is a necessary party notwithstanding he has transferred his interest in the property to a third party. As a sequitur, a suit or an appeal emanating from such a suit would abate if, upon death of the vendor, his legal heirs/ representatives are not substituted. (Para 38(2))

**Transfer of Property Act 1882- Section 52 \- Lis Pendens \-** Though a transfer lis pendens is not always void, such transferee’s title is subservient to the decree that may ultimately be passed in the pending suit. (Para 38(3))

**Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 \- Order I**\- A transferee lis pendens is not a necessary party in a suit for specific performance. (Para 38(3))

**Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 \- Order I-** A transferee lis pendens may pursue the appeal against a decree of specific performance against the vendor, as a legal representative/ inter-meddler of the estate of the vendor- The vendor would have to be impleaded as a party in the appeal and on his death, on non-substitution of his heirs /legal representatives, the appeal would abate. (Para 38(4))

**Code of Civil Procedure, 1908: Order I Rule 10- Specific Performance Suit \-** the vendor is a necessary party in a suit for specific performance of an agreement for sale, notwithstanding that vendor has transferred his interest in the subject matter of the agreement to a third party. Reason being that the transferee/ third party cannot be subjected to special covenants, if any, between the vendor and the plaintiff-purchaser. Besides that, the object of the decree of specific performance is to put the person who has agreed to purchase the property in the same position which he would have obtained in case the contracting parties i.e., vendor and the purchaser had, pursuant to the agreement, executed a deed of sale and completed it in every way. 

**Res Judicata \-** The principle applies also as between two stages in the same litigation to the extent that a court, whether the trial court or a higher court having at an earlier stage decided a matter in one way will not allow the parties to reagitate the matter again at a subsequent stage of the same proceedings. However, what is important is that this does not preclude the appellate court or a higher court to test the correctness of that decision. (Para 31\)

**Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 \-POCSO Act \- Bail ; Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015- JJ Act- Section 94 \-** Determination of age of the victim is a matter of trial and not at the stage of bail. If the age is under question, the bail Court may examine the documents produced to establish age, but it will not enter into the question of those documents being correct or not so \- A medical determination of age of a victim cannot be resorted to as a matter of course, much less mandated. It can only be employed in a given circumstance when the other stipulations of Section 94 JJ Act are not/cannot be met. (Para 16-17) If the question of age is raised at the stage of bail, it is only open for the Court to, from the perusal of the documents, take a prima facie view as to the age of the victim, not one on the correctness of the documents since that would amount to a mini trial. (Para 18\)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 439**\- Court’s jurisdiction, i.e., either the Court of Sessions or the High Court under Section 439 CrPC is limited to adjudicating the question of the person concerned being released into society pending trial or whether they should continue to be incarcerated. (Para 11.2) Section 439 is limited to granting bail or anticipatory bail and requires the Court to consider only prima facie evidence, the risk of the accused absconding, tampering with evidence, or other relevant factors- The Court cannot undertake a mini trial at the bail stage. (Para 15.3)

**POCSO Act \- Romeo – Juliet clause \-** Misuse/misapplication of the POCSO Act to settle scores and by families in opposition to relationships between young people- Government of India, to consider initiation of steps as may be possible to curb this menace (1) the introduction of a Romeo – Juliet clause exempting genuine adolescent relationships from the stronghold of this law; (2) enacting a mechanism enabling the prosecution of those persons who, by the use of these laws seeks to settle scores etc. (Para 19\)

**POCSO Act \- JJ Act \-** Unlike an offender who can claim benefit of juvenility at any point in time, even after completion of proceedings given the beneficial nature of the JJ Act, a victim of a crime cannot claim to be a juvenile at any point in time, for the charges against which an offender is tried, are intrinsically tied to the age of the victim.(Para 14.9)

**JJ Act-** The object of Section 9 is to ensure that no juvenile offender is tried as an adult merely due to an initial misclassification and to safeguard the rehabilitative and welfare-oriented spirit of the juvenile justice system by ensuring that every child in conflict with law is tried by the appropriate forum, i.e., the JJB. (Para 14.6)

**Constitutional powers and Statutory Powers \-**Constitutional powers are sovereign, foundational, and insulated from the vicissitudes of ordinary legislation; they can neither be curtailed nor expanded by parliamentary enactment. Statutory powers, by contrast, are subordinate and mutable, existing at the pleasure of the Legislature, which may at any time amend, restrict, or repeal them through the ordinary legislative process. The constitutional power cannot overshadow the statutory power, enlarging its scope beyond what has been envisaged by the statute \-while both powers rest with the High Court, one power cannot usurp the ambit of another, unless otherwise permitted by law. (Para 11.3)

**Summary**: The Supreme Court set aside an Allahabad High Court judgment that, while granting bail in a POCSO case, mandated medical age determination at the investigation’s outset and allowed bail courts to weigh age-document credibility. It held that bail jurisdiction under Section 439 CrPC is limited, age determination of the victim must follow Section 94 JJ Act during trial (medical tests only if documents are unavailable), and bail courts cannot conduct a mini-trial or fuse constitutional powers into statutory proceedings. The Court preserved existing bail orders, prospectively nullified the High Court’s directions (including in Monish and Aman), and urged consideration of reforms like a Romeo–Juliet clause to prevent misuse of POCSO in consensual adolescent relationships.

Commissioner of Income Tax, Delhi–II, New Delhi; 2026 INSC 46- S.28 Income Tax Act \- Amalgamation \- Receipt Of Shares**](https://www.caseciter.com/content/files/2026/01/Jindal-Equipment-Leasing-Consultancy-Services-Ltd-v.-Commissioner-of-Income-Tax--Delhi---II--New-Delhi--2026-INSC-46--S.28-Income-Tax-Act---Amalgamation---Receipt-Of-Shares.pdf)

**Income Tax Act, 1961 \- Section 28 \-** Receipt of shares of the amalgamated company in substitution of stock-in-trade can give rise to taxable business profits under Section 28- (Para 31\) \-The enquiry for the Court is whether, as a result of the amalgamation, the assessee has in fact realised a profit in the commercial sense. This assessment may turn on whether: (A) The old stock-in-trade has ceased to exist in the assessee’s books; (B) The shares received in the amalgamated company possess a definite and ascertainable value; and (C) The assessee, immediately upon allotment, is in a position to dispose of such shares and realise money- If these conditions are satisfied, the substitution bears the character of a commercial realisation and the profit may be taxed under Section 28\. Where, however, the allotment of shares is merely a statutory substitution mandated by the scheme of amalgamation, without yielding an immediately realisable benefit, no income can be said to accrue or be received at that stage, and taxability arises only upon the eventual sale of the shares (Para 18\)

**Income Tax Act, 1961 \- Section 260-A \-Scope \-** Limits higher appellate interference to questions of law, while at the same time, permitting the Court to deal with necessary or incidental questions that arise, provided reasons are recorded and parties are heard \-Merely because a specific substantial question of law was not framed, it cannot be concluded that prejudice was caused to the parties, if both parties had the opportunity to address the issues in dispute. (Para 9\)

**Income Tax Act, 1961 \-Difference between a charging provision and an exemption provision:** A provision that enables the levy of tax on a particular transaction is a charging provision. Only a transaction that is covered by a charging provision is taxable. Only if the transaction is taxable can there be an exemption. (Para 12.1)

**Amalgamation** \- Amalgamation, in corporate law, signifies the statutory blending of two or more undertakings into one. It is distinct from winding up: while the transferor company ceases to exist as a separate corporate entity, its business, assets, and liabilities are absorbed into and continue within the transferee \-The transferor company ceases to exist, and the transferee emerges with a blended corporate personality, inheriting all rights and liabilities. (Para 16\) Companies Act, 2013 contains no express definition of amalgamation. Amalgamation – ordinarily effected through a scheme of compromise or arrangement sanctioned by the Court or Tribunal – is founded on agreement between shareholders and creditors, but its legal effect is statutory: upon sanction, all assets, rights, and liabilities of the transferor vest in the transferee by operation of law. In other words, amalgamation is more than a mere contractual transfer; it is a statutory process of substitution. (Para 16.1)

**Indian Penal Code 1860 \- Section 299,300**\- Culpable homicide is genus, the murder is its specie. The two ingredients namely that the infliction of bodily injury on the deceased was caused intentionally and secondly, that the injury was sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature, are satisfied, the offence would become the offence of murder. However, there may be circumstances which may emerge from the operative facts and the evidence available in a given case that the offence would be one of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. (Para 5\)

**Summary**: The Supreme Court upheld appellant's conviction under Section 304 Part II IPC, rejecting charges under Sections 147, 148, and 149 due to absence of common object. Considering the appellant's age (80+) and time already served (about six years three months), the Court reduced the sentence to period undergone and dismissed the appeal subject to this modification.

**POCSO Act \- Bail \-** Mere filing of a chargesheet does not, by itself, preclude consideration of an application for bail- However, the Court is duty-bound to have due regard to the nature and gravity of the offence and the material collected during investigation- In offences involving sexual assault against children, the likelihood of tampering with evidence or influencing witnesses constitutes a grave and legitimate concern. The safety of the victim and the need to preserve the purity of the trial process assume paramount importance. (Para 12-15)

**Bail** \- Bail is not to be refused mechanically, it must not be granted on irrelevant considerations or by ignoring material evidence. (Para 16\)

**Summary**: Supreme Court set aside the bail granted to accused in a POCSO case.

**Gujarat Motor Vehicles Tax Act, 1958 ;Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 \- Section 2(28) \-** Though the term motor vehicle is wide enough but it expressly excludes some of the motor vehicles which are of special type and have been adapted for use only in factory or in any other enclosed premises from its ambit \- When the special type of vehicles meant to be used as construction equipment vehicle within the enclosed premises and as such ex-facie stands excluded from the definition of the motor vehicle as contained in Section 2 (28) – However, if any such kind of vehicles are found using roads, they would not be free from the rigors of Section 2 (28) of the Act and Section 3 of the Gujarat Tax Act and may also be subject to proceedings for seizure and penalty in accordance with the law. (Para 37-44)

**Constitution of India \- Article 265 & Seventh Schedule \- Entry 57 of List II \-** State is competent to levy and collect tax on vehicles i.e., motor vehicles if they are suitable for use on roads. (Para 28\) State tax Act cannot tax vehicles which are not suitable for being used on roads. (Para 31\)

**Companies Act, 2013: Section 212, 213 447,448**\- Where the Special Court under the Companies Act is taking cognizance of an offence under a section in the Companies Act which, if proved, would make the person(s) ‘liable under Section 447’ or ‘liable for action under Section 447’, it must also invoke Section 447 with the corresponding section and in such a case, it must comply with the bar against taking cognizance as specified in the second proviso to Section 212(6) of the Companies Act (Para 59)- The offence under Section 448 is an offence ‘covered under Section 447’ of the Companies Act mentioned in Section 212(6), since the offence under Section 448 is inextricably linked to the punishment for ‘fraud’ as mentioned in Section 447 and as such, the second proviso to Section 212(6) of the Companies Act is attracted. (Para 33\) The right recourse for a person, who makes an allegation of fraud in the affairs of a company is to file an application under Section 213 of the Companies Act before the NCLT upon satisfying the eligibility under Section 213(a) and 213(b) of the Companies Act. (Para 45\)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 482 \- Civil Nature-** mere institution or pendency of civil proceedings between the parties cannot be a ground to quash the criminal proceedings instituted by filing a complaint case or to conclude that the dispute is purely civil in nature. (Para 55\)

**Legal Doctrines \-** anything that cannot be done directly, also cannot be done indirectly. (Para 43\)

**Summary-** The Supreme Court quashed cognizance under Sections 448 and 451 of the Companies Act, holding that offences “liable under Section 447” trigger the Section 212(6) bar and cannot proceed on a private complaint without an SFIO or authorised Central Government complaint. It directed transfer of the remaining IPC offences (Sections 420, 406, 426, 468, 470, 471, 120B) to a court of proper territorial jurisdiction, clarifying that civil/NCLT proceedings do not preclude criminal trial. The Court emphasized legislative intent post‑2015 amendment, aligned with High Court views, and instructed expeditious adjudication while making no findings on merits of the IPC allegations.

**Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities of BootLeggers, Dacoits, Drug-Offenders, Goondas, Immoral Traffic Offenders \[Land-Grabbers, Spurious Seed Offenders, Insecticide Offenders, Fertiliser Offenders, Food Adulteration Offenders, Fake Document Offenders, Scheduled Commodities Offenders, Forest Offenders, Gaming Offenders, Sexual Offenders, Explosive Substances Offenders, Arms Offenders, Cyber Crime Offenders and White Collar or Financial Offenders\] Act, 1986 \-** Mere apprehension on the part of the detaining authority that in the event of the detenu being released on bail, she was likely to indulge in similar crimes that would be prejudicial to maintenance of public order would not be a sufficient ground to order her preventive detention \- Mere reproduction of the expressions mentioned in Section 2(a) of the Act of 1986 in the order of detention would not be sufficient. The detention order ought to indicate the recording of subjective satisfaction by the detaining authority in that regard.- There is a fine distinction between “law and order” and “public order”. Mere registration of three offences by itself would not have any bearing on the maintenance of public order unless there is material to show that the narcotic drug dealt with by the detenu was in fact dangerous to public health under the Act of 1986\.  (Para 9-10)

**Summary**: The Supreme Court allowed the appeal of Roshini Devi, quashing her mother’s preventive detention under the Telangana Act of 1986 because the detaining authority failed to show how her alleged drug-related activities affected public order rather than merely law and order. The Court criticized reliance on bail apprehensions and past history without taking ordinary-law measures like bail cancellation, citing precedents that preventive detention is an extraordinary remedy requiring specific, relevant material and genuine subjective satisfaction. It set aside the High Court’s dismissal, ordered the detenu’s release if not wanted elsewhere, and emphasized the distinction between public order and law and order.

### [**Sumit Bansal v. MGI Developers and Promoters 2026 INSC 40 \- NI Act \- Cheque Bounce \-Multiple Cheques**](https://www.caseciter.com/content/files/2026/01/Sumit-Bansal-v.--MGI-Developers-and-Promoters--2026-INSC-40---NI-Act---Cheque-Bounce--Multiple-Cheques.pdf)

**Negotiable Instruments Act 1881- Section 138 \-** A separate cause of action arises upon each dishonour of a cheque provided the statutory sequence of presentation, dishonour, notice, and failure to pay is complete. The fact that multiple cheques arise from one transaction will not merge them into a single cause of action- \[**Context**: In this case, the cheques forming the subject of the two complaints were distinct instruments drawn on different accounts, presented on different dates, dishonoured separately, and followed by independent statutory notices \- **SC held:** The scheme of Section 138 of the NI Act does not bar prosecution in such circumstances.  Whether those cheques were issued as alternative or supplementary instruments, or represented fresh undertakings, is a disputed question of fact requiring evidence at the time of trial and cannot be resolved at the threshold.\]

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 482 ; Negotiable Instruments Act 1881- Section 139 \-** The statutory presumption attached to the issuance of a cheque, being one made in discharge of a legally enforceable debt or liability, is required to be accorded due weight. Therefore, in circumstances where the accused approaches the Court seeking quashing of proceedings even before the commencement of trial, the Court must exercise circumspection and refrain from prematurely stifling the prosecution at the threshold, particularly by overlooking the legal presumption that operates in favour of the complainant. (Para 43\) Whether those cheques were issued as alternative or supplementary instruments, or represented fresh undertakings, is a disputed question of fact requiring evidence at the time of trial and cannot be resolved at the threshold. Questions such as whether the firm’s cheques were issued in substitution of the personal cheques, whether the parties treated them as alternative securities, and whether both were intended to be simultaneously enforceable, are all mixed questions of fact. The inherent jurisdiction of the High Court under Section 482 of the Cr.PC cannot be used to decide such disputed issues. (Para 34\)

**Negotiable Instruments Act 1881- Section 139**\- The burden of proving whether there exists any debt or liability is something which must be discharged in trial. A bare perusal of Section 139 of the NI Act would indicate that once a cheque is issued in discharge of liability and dishonoured, a presumption of liability in favour of the complainant arises. The accused person is then required to rebut the presumption by raising facts that either there was no debt or liability when the cheque was drawn, or the cheque was not drawn in discharge of liability, or notice was not served in time. (Para 42\)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 482 \-** Even though the powers under Section 482 of the Cr.PC are very wide, its conferment requires the High Court to be more cautious and diligent. While examining any complaint or FIR, the High Court exercising its power under this provision cannot go embarking upon the genuineness of the allegations made. The Court must only consider whether there exists any sufficient material to proceed against the accused or not. (Para 28\)

**Summary**: The Supreme Court addressed multiple Section 138 NI Act complaints arising from dishonoured cheques linked to a 2016 Agreement to Sell, where MGI Developers failed to execute sale deeds and issued both firm and personal cheques that were later returned unpaid. It held that each dishonour created a distinct cause of action, set aside the High Court’s quashing of Complaint Case No. 3298/2019, and allowed that case to proceed, while upholding the refusal to quash Complaint Case Nos. 2823/2019, 13508/2019, and 743/2020. The Court emphasized that disputed factual issues and the statutory presumption under Section 139 must be tested at trial, leaving all contentions open.

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 482 \- Civil Nature \-** Civil adjudication cannot always be treated as determinative of criminal culpability at the stage of quashment- Civil liability and criminal liability may arise from the same set of facts and that the pendency or conclusion of civil proceedings does not bar prosecution where the ingredients of a criminal offence are disclosed- Adjudication of forgery, cheating or use of forged documents in relation to a settlement deed will always carry a civil element. To permit quashing on the sole ground of a civil suit would encourage unscrupulous litigants to defeat criminal prosecution by instituting civil proceedings. (Para 26-28)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 482 \-Delay \-** Delay in filing a complaint, by itself, is never a ground for quashing criminal proceedings at the threshold. Whether the delay stands satisfactorily explained or whether it impacts the credibility of the prosecution, is a matter of appreciation of evidence before the Trial Court and not for summary determination by the High Court under Section 482 of the [Cr.PC](http://cr.pc/).

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 482 \- Scope \-**Even though the powers under Section 482 of the Cr.PC are very wide, its conferment requires the High Courts to be more cautious and diligent. While examining any FIR, the High Court exercising its power under this provision cannot go embarking upon the genuineness of the allegations made. The High Court must only consider whether there exists any sufficient material to proceed against the accused or not and must not be concerned with the reliability, sufficiency, or acceptability of the evidence. (Para 24\) High Court in its jurisdiction under Section 482 is bound to take the allegations (made in complaint) on its face value. Whether these allegations can ultimately be proved is a matter strictly within the province of the Trial Court (Para 25)-when a factual foundation for prosecution exists, criminal law cannot be short-circuited by invoking inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Cr.PC. Where allegations require adjudication on evidence, the proper course is to permit the trial to proceed in accordance with law.  (Para 31\)

**Summary**: The Supreme Court set aside the Madras High Court’s order quashing criminal proceedings against accused.

**Educational Courses \- Admission \-** While advertisements for private colleges explicitly state that admission does not grant a right to appointment, the absence of this specific disclaimer in government college advertisements does not mean a right to appointment is automatically implied. (Para 21\)

**Doctrine of Legitimate Expectation \- Two tests** \- (1) legitimacy of the expectation and (2) being denial of legitimate expectation that led to violation of Article 14\. (Para 26\)

**Factual Summary:** Supreme Court set aside Allahabad High Court orders that had directed Uttar Pradesh to appoint Ayurvedic Staff Nurse trainees, holding that mere admission and completion of training did not confer a right to appointment. It found that post-2011 policy changes allowing private institutions and the 2014 shift to UPSSSC recruitment, followed by 2021 service rules, required a competitive selection process, making the doctrine of legitimate expectation inapplicable.

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 2(s) \-** There need not be a specific place to be declared as a police station, as even a post being held by a police officer would constitute a police station- The definition clause is both exhaustive and inclusive. It is exhaustive to mean, any post or any place, while it includes any local area specified by the State Government. \- Section 2(0)- This is an inclusive definition, which refers to a police officer at the station house, placed next in rank to the officer in charge, and is above the rank of constable, unless the State Government otherwise so directs. (Para 4\)

**Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014- Section 2(f) \-** The term ‘law’ includes an order or other instrument having the force of law, and therefore, brings within its ambit a notification or a circular issued by a competent authority \- Section 100-102 \- Section 100 is a transitional provision, making the application of the existing law to the two States, conscious enough not to create any legal vacuum \- There is indeed no requirement for any specific order of adoption, particularly for the State of Andhra Pradesh \- The State of Andhra Pradesh continues to be the same State, as what has been done is, by merely carving out some of its territories, a new State has been created.

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 319 \- Bail-** When a person is added as an accused under Section 319 Cr.P.C. and that person is ultimately arrested and prays for bail, the relevant consideration at the end of the court while considering his plea for bail should be the strong and cogent evidence than mere probability of his complicity. The test that has to be applied is one which is more than prima facie case as exercised at the time of framing of charge, but short of satisfaction to an extent that the evidence, if goes unrebutted would lead to conviction. The Court should weigh factors like the nature of the offence, the quality of the evidence against the new accused and the likelihood of the person absconding or tampering with evidence. In other words, the court must be satisfied that there is strong and cogent evidence of the person’s complicity at the threshold i.e. much higher than that required for framing charges against the original accused.

**Arbitration and Conciliation Act \- Section 34,37**\- The scope of interference of the court with the arbitral matters is virtually prohibited, if not absolutely barred. The powers of the Appellate Court are even more restricted than the powers conferred by Section 34 of the Act. The appellate power under Section 37 of the Act is exercisable only to find out if the court exercising power under Section 34 of the Act, has acted within its limits as prescribed thereunder or has exceeded or failed to exercise the power so conferred. The Appellate Court exercising powers under Section 37 of the Act has no authority of law to consider the matter in dispute before the Arbitral Tribunal on merits so as to hold as to whether the award of the Arbitral Tribunal is right or wrong. The Appellate Court in exercise of such power cannot sit as an ordinary court of appeal and reappraise the evidence to record a contrary finding. The award of the Arbitral Tribunal cannot be touched by the court unless it is contrary to the substantive provision of law or any provision of the Act or the terms of the agreement. (Para 37\) 

**Arbitration** \- The Act is a special enactment which aims to resolve contractual/commercial disputes through arbitration with the minimum intervention of the court, if not without the intervention of the court. In the event, the courts are allowed to step in at every stage and the arbitral awards are subjected to challenge before the courts in hierarchy before court of first instance, through regular appeals and finally by means of SLP/Civil Appeal before the Supreme Court, it would obviate/frustrate and defeat the very purpose of the Act. It is therefore, necessary to accept the arbitral award if it is not patently illegal or does not fall within the scope of intervention under Section 34 of the Act. The appeal thereof has a much narrower scope of intervention particularly when the arbitral award has been upheld under Section 34 of the Act. The appellate jurisdiction acquires little significance only when the arbitral award has been erroneously upheld or set aside by the court in exercise of its power under Section 34 of the Act.

**Companies Act 2013-Section 58(3)** \- Power of the CLB to extend time or condone delay   \-The simpliciter limitation period prescribed under Section 58(3) of the Act, 2013 must not be read to be merely directory. The presence of any additional pre-emptory language in the form of “but not thereafter” or “shall” would not always be necessary to convey that the prescribed period is mandatory.Section 433 of the Act, 2013 which empowers the NCLT and the NCLAT respectively to apply the provisions of the Act, 1963, as far as may be, to the proceedings and appeals before itself, cannot be borrowed to signify the existence of a similar power with respect to the CLB. Regulation 44 of the CLB Regulations which saves the inherent power of the CLB would not enable the CLB to extend time for the filing of the appeal or the application itself, as the case may be.(Para 100\)

**Limitation Act 1963 \- Section 5 \-**The provisions of the Act, 1963 (provisions that lay down a prescribed period of limitation as well as Sections 4 to 24 of the Act, 1963 respectively) would only apply to suits, applications or appeals, as the case may be, which are made under any law to ‘courts’ and not to those made before quasi-judicial bodies or tribunals, unless such quasi-judicial bodies or tribunals are specifically empowered in that regard. (Para 160)The principles underlying Section 5 cannot be applied to quasi-judicial bodies (Para 65).  The discretionary power to adjust the period of limitation itself, must be specifically granted to the concerned quasi-judicial body or tribunal and there must be a reasonable indication from the language of the statute that such a discretion which is otherwise vested in civil courts, is also vested in the concerned quasi-judicial body. (Para 90)The argument that the principles underlying Sections 6 or 14 of the Act, 1963 respectively, could be applied to quasi-judicial bodies is not sufficient reason to hold the same insofar as Section 5 of the Act, 1963 is concerned. (Para 93\)

**Inherent Powers**\- Although the exercise of inherent powers are in addition to the powers specifically conferred on the concerned body or institution, yet such an exercise of power must be complementary to and not be in conflict with any express provision or be contrary to the intention of the legislature. It is only when a provision is silent as regards some procedural aspect that the inherent power can come to the aid of the parties. One must be  careful in ascertaining when there is an unintentional silence and when there exists a deliberate omission. (Para 100\)

**Limitation Act 1963 \- Section 29(2)-** The question whether a certain provision in a special or a local law expressly excludes the provisions of Sections 4 to 24 of the Act, 1963 respectively arises only in pursuance of the savings provision under Section 29(2) of the Act, 1963\. As a natural corollary, if Section 29(2) is, by itself, inapplicable to a particular case then there would be no need to look into or analyse whether there is any express exclusion. (Para 100\)

**Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 9,11,21-** The commencement of arbitral proceedings is a statutory event defined exclusively under Section 21, wherein the respondent’s receipt of a request to refer the dispute to arbitration sets the arbitral proceedings in motion and no judicial application i.e. whether under Section 9 or Section 11 petition, constitutes commencement. Therefore, the statutory consequences tied to commencement, including the mandate under Section 9(2), must be assessed solely with reference to the date of receipt of request invoking arbitration under Section 21\. (Para 23\) **Arbitration (Proceedings Before the Courts) Rules, 2001-Rule 9(4) \-**Section 9 does not provide for the consequences of non-compliance with its mandate of commencing arbitral proceedings within ninety days, however, the said vacuum stands statutorily filled through Rule 9(4) \- The expression “initiated” has necessarily to be read as “commenced” within the meaning of Section 21 \-Upon failure to commence arbitral proceedings within three months, the period stipulated under Rule 9(4) attracts the consequence as provided therein, namely, the interim order shall stand vacated automatically. (Para 27\)

**Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 9- I**n absence of any other provision providing for the date of commencement of the arbitral proceedings, Section 21 is to be construed to apply to all the provisions of the Act unless specifically provided as not applicable. The only exception that is carved out in Section 21 pertains to the arbitral agreement itself, providing that unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the date of commencement of arbitral proceedings must be from the date when notice or request invoking arbitration is received by the respondent. (Para 24\)

**Words and Phrases \-** The term “initiation” connotes the act of causing something to begin or taking the first step towards beginning a process, whereas “commencement” denotes the actual beginning of the process itself, which is a step further than mere initiation.

**Criminal Case \-** Disciplinary proceedings and criminal prosecution, even on an identical allegation, are parallel proceedings (Para 1\) \- Exoneration in the departmental proceeding ipso facto would not result in the quashing of the criminal prosecution. (Para 12\) \[While restoring criminal proceedings, SC observed: we are not convinced that this is a fit case where the criminal proceedings can be quashed on the exoneration of the delinquent employee in a departmental enquiry.\]

**Disciplinary Proceedings \-** The enquiry report in disciplinary proceedings is not conclusive of the guilt or otherwise of the delinquent employee, which finding is in the exclusive domain of the disciplinary authority. The enquiry officer is appointed only as a convenient measure to bring on record the allegations against the delinquent employee and the proof thereof and to ensure an opportunity to the delinquent employee to contest and defend the same by cross-examination of the witnesses proffered by the department and even production of further evidence, in defense. The enquiry officer, strictly speaking, merely records the evidence and the finding entered on the basis of the evidence led at the enquiry does not have any bearing on the final decision of the disciplinary authority. The disciplinary authority takes the ultimate call as to whether to concur with the findings of the enquiry authority or to differ therefrom. On a decision being taken to differ from the findings in the enquiry report as to the guilt of the delinquent employee, if it is in favour of the delinquent employee nothing more needs to be done since the enquiry stands closed exonerating the employee of the charges levelled. If the decision is to concur with the finding of guilt by the Enquiry Officer, then a show-cause is issued with the copy of the Enquiry Report. However, while differing from the finding of exoneration in the enquiry report, necessarily the disciplinary authority will not only have to issue a show-cause against the delinquent employee, with a copy of the Enquiry Report, but the show-cause notice also has to specifically bring to attention of the delinquent, the aspects on which the disciplinary authority proposes to differ, based on the facts discovered in the enquiry so as to afford the delinquent employee an opportunity to proffer his defense to the same.

**Negotiable Instruments Act 1881 \- Section 138, 142 \-** The power conferred upon the Court to take cognisance of a belated complaint is subject to the complainant first satisfying the Court that he had sufficient cause for not making the complaint within time. The satisfaction in that regard, resulting in condonation of the delay, must therefore precede the act of taking cognizance. (Para 14\) \[SC held that Magistrate erred in taking cognisance of the complaint under Section 138 of the NI Act, even before the delay of two days in its presentation was condoned. \]

**Practice and Procedure \- Limitation \-** Ordinarily, a proceeding instituted with limitation-linked delay before a Court of law does not actually figure as a regular matter on its file until that delay is condoned. Order XLI Rules 3A and 5(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, make this position amply clear in the context of belated presentation of civil appeals. (Para 14\)

**Education \- Admission Process \-** 'Rules of the game cannot be altered once the game has begun' Principle applicable to admission processes to educational courses as it would be to recruitment processes. Just as modification of recruitment norms is forbidden in law after the recruitment process has begun, it is equally illegal for an admission process to not be fully defined in all its contours before its commencement, so as to leave room for the authorities concerned to stipulate norms later on to suit their own interests or to permit nepotism. The transparency of such a process is paramount to ensure fairness and prevent arbitrariness. (Para 18\) When a thing is done in a post-haste manner, malafides would be presumed as anything done with undue haste can be termed arbitrary and would not be condonable in law. The aforestated principle would apply with equal vigour to an admission process relating to sought-after courses like MBBS/BDS. (Para 31\)

**Constitution of India \- Article 226,32 \- Judicial Review- Policy Decision \-** When a policy decision is riddled with arbitrariness or even provides avenues therefor, the Court would be justified in nullifying it. The fact that a policymaker is to be allowed some elbow room in formulating policy does not translate to allowing scope for arbitrariness or nepotism. (Para 37\) State and its instrumentalities have a duty and responsibility to act fairly and reasonably in terms of the mandate of Article 14 of the Constitution and that any decision taken by the State must be reasoned and not arbitrary.

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 218-223 \-**Section 218(1) CrPC requires a distinct and separate charge for every distinct offence and each such separate charge should be tried separately. Sections 219 to 223 CrPC constitute exceptions to this general rule and stipulate the circumstances in which deviation therefrom can be made. Under Section 219 CrPC, three such offences committed during a year can be the subject matter of a single trial \[now, five such offences, under Section 242 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS)\]. Under Sections 220(1) CrPC and 223(a) and (d) CrPC, consolidated charges can be framed against several accused persons in relation to several offences, if such offences are committed during the course of the same transaction. It would, therefore, turn upon the offences forming part of the ‘same transaction’ \- Triple tests, though not to be applied cumulatively, to decide when separate actions can be treated as part of the ‘same transaction’ – 1\) unity of purpose and design; 2\) proximity of time and place; and 3\) continuity of action. These tests may be applied to ascertain whether a series of acts form part of the same transaction or not \- If it is opined that all the incidents partake of the same transaction, there can be one trial under Section 220(1) CrPC and Section 223(a) and (d) CrPC. If, however, it is concluded that there are several transactions and distinct offences in relation to different victims, there have to be separate trials for each offence, subject to Section 219 CrPC/ Section 242 BNSS, which allows the Trial Court to try three/five offences of the same kind committed within a year. Once all the incidents are taken to be part of the same transaction and amalgamated into one FIR, the punishment would follow accordingly as per law. (Para 19-20)

**FIRs \-** Consolidation of FIRs is permissible in law but that would have also depended upon the conclusions to be arrived at after the investigation. (Para 21\)

**Constitution of India: Article 309 \- Bihar Engineering Services Class–II Recruitment Rules, 2019** \- The issuance of the 2022 Amendment Rules, introducing Rule 8(5) with retrospective effect from 06.03.2019, attempts to rewrite the rules of the game which has already begun. By reducing the 25 weightage of the written examination to 75 marks and introducing 25 marks for contractual experience, the State has fundamentally altered the basis of selection and changed the ‘eligibility criteria for being placed in the merit list’ which is not permissible-While the State undoubtedly has the power to amend rules under the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution of India, this power is not unbridled. The power of retrospective legislation cannot be exercised to take away vested rights or to arbitrarily disrupt a selection process that has already resulted in the identification of successful candidates by publication of a provisional merit list \-Once a candidate has cleared the written examination and found a place in the merit list based on the announced criteria in line with the extant Rules and the advertisement, a legitimate expectation arises that the selection will be finalized based on the criteria which was advertised at the time of initiation of the recruitment process- The State cannot rely on executive instructions to override statutory rules that were in force during the initiation of the recruitment process, especially to the detriment of candidates who had no notice of such weightage or age relaxation. (Para 39\) Even assuming that the 2022 Amendment Rules are policy decisions of the State, they cannot be implemented in a manner that violates the fundamental right to equality under Article 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India by changing the selection criteria after the selection process has already begun. (Para 31-41)

**Public Employment \-Recruitment** \-Participation in a recruitment process or mere placement on the merit list does not create an indefeasible right to appointment- However, changing the eligibility criteria for placement in the merit list, after conclusion of the written examination for that purpose, contrary to the extant rules prevalent at the time of the advertisement, cannot be justified on this basis.

**Tender \-Auction** \- An auction process has a sanctity attached to it and only for valid reasons that the highest bid can be discarded in an auction which is otherwise held in accordance with law. If a valid bid has been made which is above the reserve price, there should be a rationale or reason for not accepting it. Therefore, the decision to discard the highest bid must have a nexus to the rationale or the reason. Merely because the authority conducting the auction expected a higher bid than what the highest bidder had bid cannot be a reason to discard the highest bid. (Para 32\) Expectation of a higher bid in a subsequent auction cannot be a reason to cancel an auction held in accordance with law. (Para 28\)

**Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976-** The requirement of issuance of notice under Section 10(5) is mandatory and must be issued to the person(s) actually in possession of the concerned land. (Para 18\) \- The land ‘vesting’ with the State Government does not connote the transfer of possession. Rather, what is ‘deemed’ to have ‘vested’ are the aspects that have deemed i.e., by a legal fiction to have been ‘acquired’, i.e., title or interests. Possession, as explained in Hari Ram vests de jure and not de facto. ‘Acquisition’ (of title or interests) does not necessarily involve the transfer of such de facto possession. Such transfer requires certain explicit steps to be taken fter de jure possession is vested, there are three methods by which de facto possession may be transferred: the first is voluntary transfer by the possessor under Section 10(3) of the ULC Act. If possession is not voluntarily transferred, then the second method is through delivery of notice under Section 10(5) of 29 the ULC Act to the possessor. In case possession is still not transferred, then the third method involves the Competent Authority taking possession under Section 10(6) of the ULC Act (by force, if required) and delivering it to the State Government.

**Taxation Laws \-The application of the common or trade parlance test while dealing with classification disputes** a. The common or trade parlance test must be applied restrictively. Its function is limited to ascertaining the common or commercial meaning of a term found within a tariff heading or its defining criterion. b. The trade or common parlance test can be invoked when dealing with a classification dispute only when the following conditions are satisfied. i. The governing statute, including the relevant tariff heading, Section Notes, Chapter Notes, or HSN Explanatory Notes, does not provide any explicit definition or clear criteria for determining the meaning and scope of the tariff item in question. ii. The tariff heading does not include scientific or technical terms, or the words used in the heading are not employed in a specialised, technical context. iii. The application of the common parlance test must not contradict or run counter to the overall statutory framework and the contextual manner in which the term was used by the legislature. Thus, broadly speaking, the common or trade parlance test cannot be invoked where the statute, either explicitly or implicitly, provides definitive guidance. Explicit statutory guidance exists where the legislature provides a specific definition or a clear criterion for a term within the Act itself. Conversely, implicit guidance is found where the terms employed are scientific or technical in nature, or where the statutory context indicates that the words must be construed in a technical sense. It is only in a state of statutory silence, where the legislative intent remains unexpressed, that the tribunals or courts may resort to the common or trade parlance test. c. In the contemporary HSN-based classification regime, the common or trade parlance test cannot serve as a measure of first resort. It should only be employed after a thorough review of all relevant material confirms the absence of statutory guidance. d. When interpreting terms in a tariff item by relying on the basis of common or trade parlance, an overly simplified approach should be avoided, and the words should be understood within their legal context. Further, when a party asserts a meaning of a term based on common or trade parlance, it must present satisfactory evidence to support that claim. e. When a tariff item is general in nature and does not indicate a particular industry or trade circle, the common parlance understanding of that term is appropriate. However, when a tariff item is specific to a particular industry, the term must be understood as it is used within that specific trade circle. f. The common or trade parlance test cannot be used to override the clear mandate of the statute. Specifically: i. The test cannot be applied in a way that results in the reclassification of a good that is clearly identifiable under a particular heading according to the statute, simply because that good is marketed or called by a different name in trade or common parlance. ii. Conversely, the test cannot be used to challenge the classification of goods under a statutory heading if those goods retain the essential characteristics defined by that heading, even if they have a unique or specialised trade name. In other words, the character and nature of the product cannot be veiled behind a charade of terminology which is used to market the product or refer to it in common or commercial circles. g. To establish a separate commercial identity, it is essential to demonstrate that the good has undergone such a substantial transformation that it can no longer be characterised as a mere sub-type or category of a broader class and thus falls outside the ambit of the common or commercial understanding associated with such a class of goods.(Para 66\) \[SC held that the ‘mushroom growing apparatus’ is not classified as ‘machinery’ and further, that the subject goods are ‘structures’ rather than ‘parts’ of machinery.\]

**Constitution of India \- Article 14 \- Arbitrariness-** The State must abandon the colonial conception of itself as a sovereign dispensing benefits at its absolute discretion. Policies formulated and representations made by the State generate legitimate expectations that it will act in accordance with what it proclaims in the public domain. In the exercise of all its functions, the State is bound to act fairly and transparently, consistent with the constitutional guarantee against arbitrariness enshrined in Article 14 of the Constitution of India. Any curtailment or deprivation of the entitlements of private citizens or private business must be proportional to a requirement grounded in public interest. (Para 134\) 

**Legal Doctrines** \-**Promissory estoppel-** The true principle of promissory estoppel seemed to be that where one party has, by his words or conduct, made to the other a clear and unequivocal promise which is intended to create legal relations or effect a legal relationship to arise in the future, knowing or intending that it would be acted upon by the other party to whom the promise is made. Where it is in fact so acted upon by the other party, the promise would be binding on the party making it, and he would not be entitled to go back upon it, if it would be inequitable to allow him to do so, having regard to the dealings which have taken place between the parties. This would be so irrespective of whether there is any pre-existing relationship between the parties or not. (Para 115\) 

**Bureaucratic lethargy-** If the object of formulating the industrial policy is to encourage investment, employment and growth, the bureaucratic lethargy of the State apparatus is clearly a factor which will discourage entrepreneurship. (Para 133\)

**Reservation**\- **Rules for a competitive examination to be held by the Union Public Service Commission in 2013** \- Once relaxation has been taken by a reserved category candidate, they cannot be considered for unreserved vacancies.If a reserved category candidate takes benefit of relaxation though at initial stage, it will effectively amount to taking relaxation even at the final stage of the selection process because without giving relaxation to him, he was not in a position to participate in the Main examination and to set forth his claim of cadre allocation. (Para 32\) A reserved category candidate selected applying ‘General Standard’ has eligibility for allocation on unreserved vacancy as per his merit and preference if he is not lower in rank from other General category candidates, otherwise he shall be considered for allocation as per his merit and preference against the available vacancy of his category. In the said context, it is clear that for allocation of unreserved vacancy to a candidate of reserved category, the selection must be on ‘General Standard’ without availing any ‘Relaxed Standard’ in either eligibility or selection criteria. In case any ‘Relaxed Standard’ has been availed by him, his allocation of cadre would be as per his merit and preference against vacancy of his category. (Para 24\)

**Indian Contract Act 1872 \- Section 126-** ‘See to it’ guarantee in English Common Law refers to an obligation upon the guarantor to ensure that principal debtor itself, performs its own obligation and the guarantor, therefore, is in breach as soon as principal debtor fails to perform. However, a ‘See to it’ guarantee does not include an obligation to enable the principal debtor to perform its own obligation. Such an 13 arrangement would not be a guarantee under Section 126 of the Act.(Para 22\)

**Indian Contract Act 1872 \- Section 126-** For an obligation to be construed as a guarantee under Section 126 of the Act, there must be a direct and unambiguous obligation of the surety to discharge the obligation of the principal debtor to the creditor \- An undertaking to infuse funds into a borrower, so that it may meet its obligations cannot, by itself be equated with the promise to discharge the borrower’s liability to the creditor. A mere Covenant to ensure financial discipline or infusion of funds does not satisfy the statutory requirements of Section 126 of the Act. (Para 20\)

**Indian Contract Act 1872 \- Section 126 \-** **Essential ingredients of a guarantee:** (a) existence of principal debt, (b) default by the principal debtor and (c) a promise by the surety to discharge the liability of the principal debtor upon such default. Thus, a guarantee is a promise to answer for the payment of some debt, or the performance of some duty, in case of failure of another party, who is in the first instance, liable to such payment or performance . A guarantee is a security in the form of right of action against a third party. In order to constitute a guarantee there has to be a specific undertaking or unambiguous affirmation to discharge the liability of a third person in case of their default. A guarantee is governed by principles of construction generally governing other documents. A guarantee being a mercantile contract, the Court does not apply to it merely technical rules but construes it so as to reflect what may fairly be inferred to have been the parties’ real intention and understanding as expressed by them in writing and to give effect to it rather than not.

**Constitution of India \- Article 21 ; Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 \- Section 45 \-** If the State or any prosecuting agency including, the court, concerned has no wherewithal to provide or protect the fundamental right of an accused, to have a speedy trial as enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution, then the State or any other prosecuting agency should not oppose the plea for bail on the ground that the crime committed is serious. Article 21 of the Constitution applies irrespective of the nature of the crime \- Under the statutes such as PMLA, where maximum sentence is seven years, prolonged incarceration pending trial may warrant grant of bail by Constitutional Courts, if there is no likelihood of the trial concluding within a reasonable time. Statutory restrictions cannot be permitted to result in indefinite pretrial detention in violation of Article 21\. Prolonged incarceration cannot be allowed to convert pretrial detention into punishment and that documentary evidence already seized by the prosecution eliminates the possibility of tampering with the same. The right to speedy trial, enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution, is not eclipsed by the nature of the offence.  (Para 16-18)

**Bail \- Gravity of Offence \-** The court while dealing with the prayer for grant of bail has to consider gravity of offence, which has to be ascertained in the facts and circumstances of each case. One of the circumstances to consider the gravity of offences is also the term of sentence i.e., prescribed for the offence, the accused is alleged to have committed . The court has also to take into account the object of the special Act, the gravity of offence and the attending circumstances along with period of sentence. (Para 15\)

**Bail \- Economic Offences**\- All economic offences cannot be classified into one group as it may involve various activities and may differ from one case to another. Therefore, it is not advisable on the part of the Court to categorize all the offences into one group and deny bail on that basis . (Para 15\)

The decree, if any, passed in the suit would be binding only between the parties to the suit and would not infringe upon any right of a third party \- A necessary party is one without whom, no order can be made effectively, a proper party is one in whose absence an effective order can be made but whose presence is necessary for a complete and final decision on the question involved in the proceeding.

**Disciplinary Proceedings \- Judiciary \-** Only because an order is wrong or there is an error of judgment, without anything more, a judicial officer is not put through the ordeal of a disciplinary proceeding or a prosecution. (Para 29\) It is not the correctness of the verdict but the conduct of the Officer in question which is determinative. (Para 34\) Disciplinary Authority has to examine whether there has emerged from the record, one or more circumstances that indicate that the decision which forms the basis of the charge of misconduct was not an honest exercise of judicial power. (Para 36\) That merely because a different conclusion was possible is not an indicium for misconduct. (Para 39\)

**Judiciary \- Judges \-** A fearless judge is the bedrock of an independent judiciary, as much as an independent judiciary itself is the foundation on which rule of law rests. A judicial Officer is tasked with the onerous duty of deciding cases. Invariably one party to the case would lose and go back unhappy. Disgruntled elements amongst them, wanting to settle scores may raise frivolous allegations. (Para 27\)

**Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996- Section 12(5)-** The ineligibility of an arbitrator can be waived only by an express agreement in writing. The requirement of the waiver to be made expressly in the form of agreement in writing ensures that parties are not divested of their right to object inadvertently or by procedural happenstance. (Para 89-90) A notice invoking the arbitration clause under Section 21, a procedural order, submission of statement of claim, the filing an application seeking interim relief, or a reply to an application under Section 33 cannot be countenanced to mean “an express agreement in writing” within the meaning of the proviso to sub-section (5) of Section 12\. (Para 96\) The arbitrator upon entering reference and at the very first hearing, to ensure from the parties that they are willing to participate in the proceedings and to insist upon a written agreement waiving the requirement of Section 12(5) (Para 121\)

**Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996- Section 12(5)-** A challenge to an arbitrator’s ineligibility could be raised at any stage because an award passed in such circumstance is non-est, i.e., it carries no enforceability or recognition in law \- When an arbitrator is found to be ineligible by virtue of Section 12(5) read with the Seventh Schedule, his mandate is automatically terminated. In such circumstance, an aggrieved party may approach the court under Section 14 read with Section 15 for appointment of a substitute arbitrator. Whereas, when an award has been passed by such an arbitrator, an aggrieved party may approach the court under Section 34 for setting aside the award. (Para 123-iv)

**Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996- Section 18 \-** The principle of ‘equal treatment of the parties’ means that the parties must have the possibility of participating in the constitution of the arbitral tribunal on equal terms \-Equal participation of the parties in the process of appointment of arbitrators entails that the contracting parties have an equal say in the constitution of the arbitral tribunal. Such participation eliminates the likelihood of challenges to the arbitrator at a later stage. It is needless to say that independence and impartiality in arbitral proceedings would be served only when the parties participate equally at all stages \- The principle of party autonomy does not obliterate the principle of equal treatment of the parties, either in the procedure for appointment of arbitrators or in the arbitral proceedings. The exercise of party autonomy has to be in consonance with the principles of equal treatment of parties, which impliedly include the independence and impartiality of arbitrators. (Para 32-39)

**Arbitration Law \-** In the absence of any contrary stipulation in the agreement, arbitral proceedings commence when a notice invoking arbitration is received by the respondent.  (Para 49\)

**Arbitration Act \- Section 21 \-** The notice under Section 21 is an expression to set the arbitration agreement into motion upon arising of disputes between the parties. The section states that the date of commencement of arbitration would be the date on which the recipient receives the notice from the claimant that the dispute be referred to arbitration. The notice acts as a communication that the sender is aggrieved and seeks to invoke the arbitration agreement. It does not, by itself, operate as consent to any appointment to be made in the future.

**Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 11 \-** In a proceeding under Section 11, the Court is to confine the examination to the existence of an Arbitration Agreement \- The jurisdiction is only to inspect or scrutinize the dealings between the parties for determination about the existence of an Arbitration Agreement and not to launch a laborious or a contested inquiry. (Para 15-17)

**Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \-** Creation of a specific forum as a substitute for Civil Court or specifying the Civil Court may not be enough to accept the inference of implicit non-arbitrability. Conferment of jurisdiction on a specific court or creation of a public forum though eminently significant, may not be the decisive test to answer and decide whether arbitrability is impliedly barred. (Para 21\)

**Presidency Small Cause Courts Act, 1882 \-Section 41-** Section 41 is a provision conferring jurisdiction on the Small Causes Court for certain types of disputes and cannot be interpreted to mean that ex proprio vigore (by its own force), it neutralizes arbitration clauses in agreements (Para 21\)

**Arbitration and Conciliation Act \- Section 21-** The object is only for the purpose of commencement of arbitral proceedings is also well settled. Section 21 is concerned only with determining the commencement of the dispute for the purpose of reckoning limitation. There is no mandatory prerequisite for issuance of a Section 21 notice prior to the commencement of Arbitration. Issuance of a Section 21 notice may come to the aid of parties and the arbitrator in determining the limitation for the claim. Failure to issue a Section 21 notice would not be fatal to a party in Arbitration if the claim is otherwise valid and the disputes arbitrable. (Para 16\) 

**Arbitration and Conciliation Act \- Section 23 \-** Once the Arbitral Tribunal is constituted claims, defence and, counter claims are filed. Party which normally files the claim first is, for convenience, referred to as the ‘claimant’ and the party which responds is called the Page 40 of 41 ‘respondent’. The said respondent is also along with the defence statement entitled to file its counter claim. Hence, to contend that the appellant cannot be referred to as a claimant because no notice under Section 21 has been issued is completely untenable. (Para 20\)

**Arbitration and Conciliation Act \- Section 7- Arbitration Agreement \-** If an arbitration agreement provides that all disputes between the parties relating to the contract shall be referred to arbitration, the reference contemplated is the act of parties to the arbitration agreement.

### [**Gulfisha Fatima vs State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi) 2026 INSC 2- Delhi Riots Cases \-UAPA \- Terrorist Acts- Bail**](https://www.caseciter.com/content/files/2026/01/Gulfisha-Fatima-vs-State--Govt.-of-NCT-of-Delhi--2025-INSC-1--Delhi-Riots-Cases.pdf)

**UAPA \- Section 43D(5) \- Propositions governing the application of Section 43D(5) \-**First, the provision embodies a deliberate legislative departure from ordinary bail jurisprudence, premised upon the distinctive nature of offences under Chapters IV and VI of the Act. Second, the expression “prima facie true” mandates a threshold judicial inquiry which is neither perfunctory nor adjudicatory, requiring the Court to examine whether the prosecution material, taken at face value, discloses the essential statutory ingredients of the alleged offence. Third, the inquiry is necessarily accused specific, directed to the role and attribution qua the individual, and does not admit of collective or undifferentiated treatment merely because allegations arise from a common transaction or conspiracy. Fourth, the bail stage under Section 43D(5) is not a forum for evaluating defences, weighing evidence, or conducting a minitrial; judicial restraint at this stage is not an abdication of duty but a fulfilment of the statutory mandate. These propositions, read together, define the contours of judicial power and responsibility under the provision.he correct application of Section 43D(5), therefore, requires the Court to undertake a structured inquiry confined to the following: i. whether the prosecution material, accepted as it stands, discloses a prima facie case satisfying the statutory ingredients of the offence alleged; ii. whether the role attributed to the accused reflects a real and meaningful nexus to the unlawful activity or terrorist activity proscribed under the Act, as distinguished from mere association or peripheral presence; and iii. whether the statutory threshold is crossed qua the individual accused, without embarking upon an assessment reserved after fullfledged trial \- Where these requirements are met, the statutory restraint on the grant of bail must operate with full force; where they are not, the embargo stands lifted. This approach preserves the legislative purpose of the Act, and ensures that the exceptional nature of the bail regime under Section 43D(5) is neither diluted by overreach nor distorted by mechanical application. (Para 81-82)

**UAPA \- Section 15 \-** “Terrorist act”- The means by which such acts may be committed are not confined to the use of bombs, explosives, firearms, or other conventional weapons alone \- To construe Section 15 as limited only to conventional modes of violence would be to unduly narrow the provision, contrary to its plain language \- Apart from death or destruction of property, the provision expressly encompasses acts which disrupt supplies or services essential to the life of the community, as well as acts which threaten the economic security of the nation. This reflects Parliament’s recognition that threats to sovereignty and security may arise through conduct that destabilises civic life or societal functioning, even in the absence of immediate physical violence \- terrorist activity may involve multiple actors performing different roles towards a common unlawful objective. (Para 86-90)

**Constitution of India \- Article 21 ; UAPA \- Section 43D \-** In prosecutions alleging offences which implicate the sovereignty, integrity, or security of the State, delay does not operate as a trump card that automatically displaces statutory restraint. Rather, delay serves as a trigger for heightened judicial scrutiny. The outcome of such scrutiny must be determined by a proportional and contextual balancing of legally relevant considerations, including (i) the gravity and statutory character of the offence alleged, (ii) the role attributed to the accused within the alleged design or conspiracy, (iii) the strength of the prima facie case as it emerges at the limited threshold contemplated under the special statute, and (iv) the extent to which continued incarceration, viewed cumulatively in the facts of the case, has become demonstrably disproportionate so as to offend the guarantee of personal liberty under Article 21- Thus, when the composite evaluation yields a clear conclusion that continued detention has crossed the bounds of constitutional permissibility that the Court may justifiably intervene notwithstanding statutory restrictions. (Para 56-57)

**UAPA \- Section 43D(5) \-** The law does not require the prosecution to demonstrate, at the bail stage, that the accused personally caused death or destruction, or personally stocked explosives, before Section 43D(5) can apply. It requires the Court to see whether the material discloses a prima facie case of involvement in the unlawful activity alleged.  (Para 216\)

**UAPA** \- Not every disruption of traffic, not every blockade, and not every law-and-order incident engages the statutory framework of the UAPA. The statute is attracted only where the conduct alleged, taken cumulatively, is capable of being understood as threatening the unity, integrity, security, or sovereignty of the nation, or as creating a climate of fear and paralysis transcending ordinary disorder. (Para 227\)

**UAPA**\- Gender, while not conferring immunity from criminal law, remains a relevant consideration in determining the necessity of continued pre-trial detention. \- The law does not envisage incarceration as a measure of deterrence at the pre-trial stage, particularly where the individual concerned is a woman with no prior criminal antecedents and whose alleged actions stem from a ground-level facilitating role.

**Factual Summary: Delhi Riots Case \-** Supreme Court declined bail to Sharjeel Imam and Umar Khalid for their alleged central, planning roles, but granted bail to Gulfisha Fatima, Meeran Haider, Shifa-ur-Rehman, Mohd. Saleem Khan, and Shadab Ahmed, whose roles were found operational and peripheral, subject to stringent conditions. The Court directed expedited trial, especially examination of protected witnesses, and allowed Imam and Khalid to renew bail after a year or completion of protected-witness testimony.

**Law of Precedent \-** The discipline of precedent is not a matter of personal predilection; it is an institutional necessity \- Legal Maxim \- Stare decisis et non quieta movere \- to stand by what is decided and not to disturb what is settled, is a working rule which secures stability, predictability and respect for judicial outcomes. The law cannot change with the change of the Bench. When a coordinate Bench of a High Court has already determined a question of law, a subsequent Bench of equal strength is bound to follow that view; if it doubts its correctness, the only permissible course is to refer the matter to a larger Bench. (Para 78- 80\)

**Legal Maxim-** Stare decisis et non quieta movere \- to stand by what is decided and not to disturb what is settled, is a working rule which secures stability, predictability and respect for judicial outcomes. (Para 78\) Interest reipublicae ut sit finis litium \- It is in the public interest that there be an end to litigation would squarely apply; the State must exemplify obedience to judgments, not resistance to them. (Para 84\)

**Constitution of India \- Article 32,226-** Delegated legislation is subject to judicial review not only for substantive unreasonableness, but also for purpose. Where the dominant purpose for which a delegated power is conferred is departed from, and the power is pressed into service to achieve an end for which it was never granted, the exercise is ultra vires. The immunity of a fiscal notification from scrutiny is no greater than that of any other form of subordinate legislation. (Para 56\)

**Legislation \- Taxation \-** A delegate cannot do indirectly what it has no authority to do directly. The power to exempt is not a power to tax. The two stand on opposite constitutional planes. The essential legislative function of imposing a tax or duty rests with Parliament and must be located in a charging provision. The executive cannot, by subordinate instrument, enlarge the field of taxation under the pretext of tailoring an exemption. (Para 55\)

**Fiscal jurisprudence:** a tax or duty can only be levied where there is (i) a clear charging provision enacted by competent legislature; (ii) an identifiable taxable event; and (iii) a statutory rate-making mechanism. The machinery provisions may regulate assessment and collection. Exemption notifications may relax or remit the levy. But neither machinery provisions nor exemption notifications can substitute for the absence of a charge. (Para 59\)

**Motor Accident Compensation \-** Claimants claimed that deceased was cultivating land and involved in animal husbandry and milk vending \- SC held: Even if the land which may be owned by the family is still subsisting the contribution of the male member of the family needs to be assessed. There is vast difference between the quality of contribution by a family member as compared to an employee. His working hours are not fixed. Any person who has an opportunity certainly tries to do as much work as he can do to support his family and also see that they live in comfort. Farming is not a regular vocation. The farmers remain engaged in doing animal husbandry and milk vending as well side by side, which also generates extra income for them \- The income of the deceased can be increased from ₹5,000/- per month, as taken by the High Court, to ₹8,000/- per month.

**Constitution of India \- Article 226 \- High Court Direction for filing of charge-sheets by the investigating agency \-** If the High Court directs, at a stage prior to conclusion of investigation, that a charge-sheet has invariably to be filed upon closure of investigation in a particular case irrespective of what the materials are which have been collected during investigation and without allowing the investigating officer to form his own opinion as regards the next course of action, that would take away the discretion of such officer and he would be left with no other option but to proceed in the direction as required by the high court under pain of threat of contempt. Other than very extreme cases, the high courts ought to exercise restraint and not issue such directions which foreclose the discretion of the executive. \[**Context**: The appellant had filed a writ petition before the Madras High Court seeking action on his complaints alleging abuse of power and false cases by the police, but the High Court, while dismissing the writ, went on to direct the police to file charge‑sheets in pending cases within four months and the trial courts to complete trials within six months \- In Appeal, set aside this direction issued by the High Court.\]

**Public Auction \-** Authorities (such as banks, recovery officers, or state bodies) conducting public auctions are legally required to disclose all known encumbrances and litigation relating to the property, as failure to do so invalidates the sale. Suppressing such material facts renders the auction fraudulent or vitiated by material irregularity \-Public auction is one of the modes of sale intending to get highest competitive price for the property. Public auction also ensures fairness in actions of the public authorities and their officers who should act fairly and objectively. Their actions should be legitimate. Their dealing should be free from suspicion. Nothing should be suggestive of bias, favouritism, nepotism or beset with suspicious features of underbidding detrimental to the legitimate interest of the stakeholders.

**Provident Funds Act, 1925 \-Indian Succession Act, 1925 \-** In cases of a valid nomination, the amount in the provident fund account of the deceased depositor or subscriber is required to be released to the nominee \- The requirement to have a probate or letters of administration or succession certificate even in cases of valid nomination will invariably make the Government a party to litigation which should ideally only be between private parties \- A nominee is a mere trustee to collect the funds and not the beneficial owner- The mere fact that the amount is released to a valid nominee will not bar the objector(s) or holder(s) of probate or letters of administration or succession certificate from claiming their share from the amount released to the nominee from a competent court.

**Indian Penal Code 1860 \- Sections 307, 323, 324, 452, 504, 506 \-** SC quashed criminal proceedings by invoking Article 142 powers by recording written undertaking that accused will look after his wife and child “nicely” and “not harm them in any manner whatsoever” \- The commission of an offence inevitably implicate broader societal ramifications and invite a response grounded in deterrence. However, the exercise of judicial discretion must be guided by the circumstances of the case. Where a lawful resolution ensures the welfare of the wife and the child, the continuation of criminal proceedings may not always advance the ends of justice. In such cases, bringing the proceedings to a close may serve both individual and societal interests by encouraging responsibility and stability. (Para 4-6)

### [**Vijay Kumar v. State of Rajasthan \- Criminal Trial Pending- Interim Orders**](https://www.caseciter.com/content/files/2026/01/Vijay-Kumar--v.-State-of-Rajasthan---Criminal-Trial-Pending--Interim-Orders--.pdf)

**Criminal Trials \-** If criminal trials in such serious offences remain pending for years together on the strength of interim orders passed by the High Courts, it would lead to nothing but mockery of justice. Justice has to be done with all the parties. Justice cannot be done only with the accused persons. Justice has to be done even with the victim and the family members of the victim. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere- Chief Justices of all the High Courts requested to ensure that the petitions wherein interim orders are passed holding up the trials should be immediately taken up for hearing, more particularly in sensitive and serious matters like murder, dowry death, rape etc. (Para 29-30)

**Context**: Supreme Court of India dismissed SLP filed against High Court’s rejection of their 2003 criminal revision against framing charges under IPC Sections 498A and 304B in a dowry death case. Disturbed by a 23-year delay during which an interim stay halted the trial, the Court ordered the Rajasthan High Court’s Registrar General to send the full record and provide a year-wise breakup of criminal revision filings and disposals from 2001–2026, plus details of listings in this case. It also sought the State’s explanation for inaction, urged Chief Justices to promptly hear matters where interim orders stall serious trials, and listed the case for further orders on 15-01-2026.

### 

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973- Section 389 \-** There are two types of sentences that the Trial Court can impose depending on the nature of the offence. Some orders of sentence are for a fixed term, unlike the order of sentence of life imprisonment-When a convicted person is sentenced to a fixed period of sentence and when he files an appeal under any statutory right, suspension of sentence should be considered by the Appellate Court liberally unless there are exceptional circumstances.

**Indian Stamp Act \- Section 2(5)- Bond \-** An instrument by which a person puts himself under an obligation to pay a sum of money to another on condition that the obligation shall be void if some specific act is, or is not, performed is a bond. The only question to pose is: Has the executant of the instrument put himself under an obligation, or bound himself, to pay a sum of money to another, the obligation to be void under specified circumstances? If the executant can be sued for that sum of money only upon the strength of the instrument, the instrument is a bond- Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) \-MOU cannot be treated as Bond when it is signed by both the parties and not by one of the parties binding himself to pay the amount and making the said payment subject to fulfillment of some conditions- The contents of the documents would not attract clauses (a) to (c) of Section 2(5) so as to call it a Bond because the obligation to pay the money is not dependent on any condition and that the document is signed by both the parties making it an agreement \- An instrument by which a person puts himself under an obligation to pay a sum of money to another on condition that the obligation shall be void if some specific act is, or is not, performed is a bond. The only question to pose is: Has the executant of the instrument put himself under an obligation, or bound himself, to pay a sum of money to another, the obligation to be void under specified circumstances?

**National Highways Act, 1956 \-** The remedy provided to an expropriated land owner/interested party, if such person is aggrieved by the rate of compensation determined by the competent Authority, is to invoke arbitration under Section 3G(5) read with provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act \- Land owners, whose land is acquired under the 1956 Act, vis-à-vis the land owners whose lands are acquired now under the New Act, have been treated as separate classes, apparently without any intelligible differentia- While there seems to be a lot of legislative wisdom discernible from the mechanism encapsulated under the 1956 Act, to the effect that the acquisition under this Act must take place in a time-bound and expeditious manner so that the development of National Highways is not hampered or delayed. Though such a legislative policy is laudable, prima facie, it seems that this object can be kept intact while ensuring the land owners that they will be entitled to assessment of compensation for the acquired land in the same manner as is determined for the land owners whose lands are acquired under the Old Act or under the New Act, even when such acquisition is also for infrastructural development \- **Suggestion**: Union of India should revisit the legislative scheme and consider the desirability of bringing parity in the matter of providing a mechanism for the determination of the market value of acquired land with reference to Article 300-A of the Constitution of India.

**Public Employment \- Regular and Contractual \- Distinction \-** Employment under a State entity is a public asset and every citizen of the country has a right to apply for it. In a regular employment, directly made by the said State entity, there are safeguards to ensure that the system of employment/engagement is transparent and fulfills a minimum criteria and is open to all eligible persons and a mode/procedure is adopted for ultimately choosing the right person. When employees/workmen are taken through a contractor, it is the absolute discretion of the contractor as to whom and through which mode he would choose such persons to be sent to the principal- If the persons who are employed through a contractor, and have come to work, are given equal benefit and status as a regular employee, it would amount to giving premium and sanction to a process which is totally arbitrary as there is no mode prescribed in any contract as to how the contractor would employ or choose the persons who are to be sent, except for the basic qualification, i.e., knowledge in the field for which they are required. (Para 9\)

**Quotes \-** Sometimes justice is required to be tempered with mercy as human factors cannot be totally lost sight of. (Para 11\)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 374, 397, 389 \-** directing the accused to be present before the Appellate Court or the Revisional Court would not be warranted particularly after an order for suspension of sentence has been passed and bail has been granted- to call upon the accused to be present on every date of hearing before the Revisional Court or the Appellate Court would be burdensome to such accused and same is not warranted at all and it would serve no purpose. In the event of appeal or revision being dismissed the consequences would automatically follow and the jurisdictional magistrate would be fully empowered to secure the presence of such accused in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

**Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989: Sections 3(1)(r), 3(1)(s) \-** Even mere knowledge of the fact that the complainant is a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe is not sufficient to attract Section 3(1)(r) \- Merely abusing a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe would not be enough- Saying caste name would also not constitute an offence-To constitute an offence under Section 3(1)(s) it would be necessary that the accused abuses a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe “by the caste name” in any place within public view. Thus, the allegations must reveal that abuses were laced with caste name, or the caste name had been hurled as an abuse- The element of humiliation is present in Section 3(1)(s) as well. It has to be gathered from the intentional insult towards the caste, and the content. The content under Section 3(1)(s) are the abuses hurled at a person belonging to a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe. However, the intent with which the abuses were hurled must be found to be denigrating towards the caste, resulting into a feeling of caste-based humiliation. (Para 12-18)

**Preventive Detention \- Tamil Nadu Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers, Drug Offenders, Goondas, Immoral Traffic Offenders and Slum Grabbers Act, 1982 \-** Grant of bail to some other person in some other case cannot be a ground to believe that the detenue, who is involved in some other case, is likely to be released on bail. \[**Context**: While ordering release of a detenue, SC observed: the bail prayer of the detenue had already been rejected by the Court of Session and there was no fresh bail application filed by the detenue. Further, there is nothing on record to indicate that co-accused of the case in which the appellant was under judicial custody was admitted to bail on the date the detention order was passed. Detaining authority though, in the Grounds of detention referred to some other person being admitted to bail in some other case, did not disclose the facts of that case to demonstrate that it was so similar that a reasonable satisfaction could be drawn that detenue is likely to benefit from it and be released on bail.
